Ads are thorough rubbish and nobody would pay exorbitant prices for plus.

I am compelled to use both the hands. Please add this feature . This feature is also available in google search bar (as an example),Positive
oxford.dictionaryofenglish,Education,"This seems to be the best of the Oxford dictionary apps so far for a word enthusiast. The best part is the OCR function for using on phisyical books, and I hope the developers will work on improving it because of its occasional inability to find the word I want to define. For example, the OCR window should be the size of one word, so I can easily search it, and not the size of a paragraph - I would rather define the one word I don't know than fifty which are already familliar.",Positive

The contents of the dictionary are easy to browse through on the app. You can digest a few new concepts every time you open the app, every word of the day.",Positive
oxford.dictionaryofenglish,Education,"Excellent even with the upgrade nag screens. It's a pity that the Oxford dictionary for PCs in the (UK) Microsoft Store is an older version than this with fewer new words, as it would be great to use this more up-to-date Android version on a Windows PC too (without having to use an Android emulator like BlueStacks as I do now, which is slow and cumbersome).",Positive

oxford.dictionaryofenglish,Education,"Pressing the enter key after typing a word makes the app misbehave (It doesn't find the word). When you type space after a word it works fine.

Wikipedia,Education,"The UI/UX is funky and not very intuitive. Sometimes clicking things replaces your most recent tab, and you have to get back to the explore tab by a button hidden in the dot menu. Instead, I think it should be more like chrome. There should be a navigation bar at the bottom that doesn't change (Tabs, Saved, More). The ""more"" tab could have places, edits, settings, profile, etc. The ""tabs"" tab could operate like chrome, where the explore/home page is be a button in the top.",Positive

Wattpad ,Education,"I had downloaded this program to test for my step son who is learning English. I'm a native English speaker. This program stated that my pronunciation was at an intermediate level. I might have thought maybe I could improve my English, except the majority of my work involves being able to speak clearly and correctly. It gets a 1 star because it apparently doesn't rate your ability correctly... the whole point of the app.",Negative
Wattpad ,Education,I paid the yearly subscription and regretted it a lot the app has problems ho recognize several sounds and gives it as an error and so not let you go ahead in next exercise. I thought it was my English pronunciation. But then I gave it to couple of native speakers and it didnt work with them. It wasnt for one exercise. This problem happens in several exercises.

I tried to deside that question with their support. With Brannon Cho. But it looks like they can't help me to use my pro account I bought.,Negative
Wattpad ,Education,"I used to love this app, and I was even thinking about pay for it, I recommend it to all my friends, but the last upgrade's awful, we can't use the dictionary as before, we just have three tentatives, it's so sad, and when I tried to see how much the full version was, it increased absurdly 3 times more than before, it's really ridiculous, I'm unistalling ðŸ™„",Negative
Wattpad ,Education,"First, I'm an English teacher myself and studied in the US. I had my native friends test this app out and they didn't even pass. Secondly, a pronunciation app itself is not an equivalent of a complete english learning system or program. It is certainly a key part but only after you already have listening, speaking, vocabulary then there's no actual fluency (not to mention slangs and idioms and real life expressions). YouTube has all the pronunciation tutorials you need for free.",Negative
Wattpad ,Education,"Absolutely useless app. I gave this app another person with beginner English level, and this person read with pauses, mispronounced almost each word, made stress on wrong syllables. And how do you think, what the result of this test was? 80% native speaker! This is silly, this app doesn't work. I see many likes here, but it's because all these people feels themselves a great English speakers (and it is not truth). The only thing that works, you can compare your phrases with native speaker (the app record each your attempt and you can hear yourself). But you can do the same without this app, just use youtube and sound recorder from your phone (and do it for free, without premium subscription, that you need for using of this app).",Negative
Wattpad ,Education,"I must give a warning to everyone who intends to use Elsa. I really had a bad experience when I start using this app, they pop up the free 7 trial days but automatically, it linked with my credit card and set payment without my confirmation. I lost $9 for 3 months and auto renew after 3 months. Although the amount is not much but it made me feel unsafe on what they did. I do not recommend using this app.XXX",Negative
Wattpad ,Education,"Please be aware that the app quietly increased the price of monthly subscription from $3.99 to $11.99 and yearly subscription from $29.99 to $74.99. There used to be frequent offers to get the yearly subscription for as long as $23.99! Also please note that there are frequent price fluctuations, and often the price for the same service can vary right within the app. Right now, I can subscribe for yearly subscription for $74.99, $59.99 or $37.49 simply depending on where you click inside the app.",Negative
Wattpad ,Education,"This app works with some algorithms. If you say wrong any word, you gotta say it more than 10 times. Specially say any word incorrect twice in a row. After that even you will say the word absolutely clearly the algorithm will find a mistake. Even tenth attempt is true, if you will move forward and say the same word twelfth time, it will be a wrong answer. Good app for most of Asian people who don't know the correct pronunciations, after eleventh attempt they'll reach it and feel satisfied.",Negative
Wattpad ,Education,This is worst app I have ever used because of you pronounce a word wrong then also it do it right. This app can destroy your vocabulary and pronunciation. I would not recommend this app and if you want to use it then it is up to you to destroy your pronunciation..ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,Negative
Wattpad ,Education,"Selecting ""Urdu"" as a native language in discovery phase results into a gibberish language instead of Urdu. Disappointed By the first impression. I can't even understand what it is saying and don't have an option in English to revert back the language. Had to reinstall all over and still getting the issue if Urdu as language is selected.",Negative
Wattpad ,Education,"Totally useless. It randomly recognizes or rejects what you saying, there is no logic behind it. Had been using for a while but seen no improvement. Doesn't show you how to produce some sounds. Just some useless text. It accepts the %90 of input even if it was wrong and randomly rejects even it is right, just enough illusion to make it seem doing something. Also records all your voice and STORES them on their servers indefinately. When you request delete it is still there.",Negative
Wattpad ,Education,great app for me,Negative
Wattpad ,Education,"sounds very American, not good for received pronunciation ðŸ™   Update following developer's response: Is even discrimination assuming that everyone is speaking American English.  Last update: Thank you for the response. Teaching American pronunciation is totally fine for whoever is interested on it. The title here in google play however indicates that you support the original English Accent (English originates from England). Finding that this is not the case is confusing to whoever is not interested in American pronunciation in particular. Perhaps you could indicate any particular dialect you support in the tittle and make your application more complete and professional.",Negative
Wattpad ,Education,I tried to upgrade my subscription and it's messed up. It won't work.. the letters on the screen are superimposed. You click on upgrade and nothing happens. What a mess.. That's the reason why I gave it only one star,Negative

We just can't get past a measly 93% in the assessment test and not only that, we always get the very same mistakes every single time we take that test.",Negative
Wattpad ,Education,"It is getting worse. Please fix the bug about calculating the percentage at the end of the review screen, it drives me crazy every single time after trying to prounounce the phases like 10 times, and then it gives me the score of the first time. No longer want to try more.",Negative
Wattpad ,Education,"My speech is absolutely similar to the sample, but because the program cuts my words incorrectly (for example I say your, but the program recognises it as yu, basically it doesn't recognise the words properly) , it doesn't even highlight my actual mistakes. Moreover it even adds mistakes.",Negative
Wattpad ,Education,"I request everybody, please don't use this app. If you go with subscription, then monthly it will start deducting money from your account and if you want to stop subscription then their is not any option to cancel subscription in the app. Yes, you read correctly. NO OPTION TO CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION. You will end up paying money monthly even you dont want. You can go thorough the other reviews on this. My bad before installing App, I did not read reviews. Thanks",Negative
Wattpad ,Education,"The assessment test is inaccurate. After you take the test you will find sample recordings of the scripts from the test read by a native speaker appearing in the ""Detailed script report"". I recorded them, retook the test and instead of reading the scripts myself played the recordings. Guess what score I got. 64  ",Negative
Wattpad ,Education,"Really?! Not even letting me to browse through functiality and see how it works? I need to sign up and give my card details straight away?

Wattpad ,Education,"This app is a total scam! I am a native English speaker yet I could not get 100% on the pronunciation. I thought this app would help with my students'  English accent but after trying it out, I won't be using this app as a resource for my English class. I got frustrated when using this so imagine my bilingual students who are not confident about their English accent. It will only lower the self-confidence in speaking English.",Negative

Wattpad ,Education,"ElsaSpeak is very responsive at the start when you're a potential customer for the app but then they'll ignore all your messages once you've bought the product.

Wattpad ,Education,"I am an English teacher. I tried doing the exercises while intentionally making errors that my students typically make (dropped final sounds, failure to pronounce consonant clusters, etc.). The app cannot hear my pronunciation and told me that I was saying everything correctly. This could be really disastrous for learners who think they are improving their accent, but really are getting completely misguided. This app is absolutely not sophisticated enough to do what it purports to do. Stay away.",Negative
Wattpad ,Education,I don't think there will be changes after feedback. I wouldn't recommend it because there's lots of problem that needs to be fixed! I can only see good UI of the app but not the usability. I would rather suggest some other apps which are good enough to help and provide better proficiency in English.,Negative

Elsa,Education,"This app lags a lot. Stops responding every now and then. It's troublesome to find ""Study"" option for a newly taken challenge. ""Practice"" option is so time consuming and manual. It needs to be fast and somewhat automatic rather than constant tapping next button for each. It'd be even better if you add the functionality to find all the available challenges that can be studied. I'd suggest that you should redesign the user experience and some performance improvement is very necessary.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Exceptionally mediocre execution of a fairly good idea. Needs the ability to cast to devices other than Chrome, or an integrated app on smart devices and smart TVs. Needs attention to buggy code which makes it so chosen settings do not always apply to launched game. It would be one thing if these flaws existed in the free tier, but at 15$/month I expect much higher quality than this trash.",Negative
Elsa,Education,Horrible game. It's always laggy and it steals private information. Do not install.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"I want the screen to fully light up green or red when someone answers the question. The best part of kahoot is seeing the screen light up red as someone gets the wrong answer. It adds to the fun, but someone has brought to my attention you have taken this feature out and made the check mark smaller so others can't see if you got the answer right or wrong. Change it back to the way it was.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"I thought your app was great and the solution to my problem. I died when I choose quiz option but it says make the question short. I was so happy when I found your app. Unfortunately.. I wasn't able to make a quiz because it says make it short. Pls make feature that I can give same quiz to my friends at the same date and time. And I will be able to see their answer LIVE. PLS MAKE IT A LIVE QUIZ. At least I can give 1 same quiz to 10 people pls. If this happened, i will give 5 stars.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Horrible app. More stressful than fun. You can get a right answer, but take one second to figure it out and you could be bumped to last place. If you want a app that will help you with revision, just take quizlet instead. It is less stressful, more educational, and more fun.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Why I gave 1 ðŸŒŸ - specifically for schools using this app for quiz to create a competition among small kids to come at the top. This damn app more of a ""fastest finger fast"" like KBC. Imagine the young minds struggle to come top irrespective of knowing right answers..WHY? It depends not just on their intelligence, but more on the speed of mobile or tablet, speed of internet, response from site, and many more things. As a parent, I just hate this app..causing lot of damage to child psychology.",Negative
Elsa,Education,Very dissappointed. I am pretty sure i cancelled my free trial and i was still charged for a whole year. Now they and google both refuse to pay back. What an interesting way to get money from your pocket!,Negative

Elsa,Education,"Drastically lowered the live user # on all plans along with the plan options in general vs plans from 2 years ago. Contacted support looking for a 1-2 kahoot a month plan for ~100 live users and was told there's no option for that (and support ignored my question if they could just offer a discount on a plan that has that user count with a note on my account on the volume I'm allowed otherwise it's removed). I'm fine if that runs me $5-$10 per Kahoot game. Literally tried to give them my money, and they didn't want it- kind of upsetting.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Stupid games, connection gets lost consistently, lastly half of the videos get blocked on YouTube makes it impossible to play. Look somewhere else",Negative
Elsa,Education,When I go to a quiz it just goes blank and plays the music and even if it works I can't go to the next question it goes blank and only plays the music,Negative

Elsa,Education,Cant see the question or answers just the shape's so when playing with others I've got to guess what colour/ shape rather than reading the question and choosing the answer,Negative
Elsa,Education,The app keeped not letting me do preview on quizes I am making and let me only do one part on other quizes from others so it is making me mad 0 stars!,Negative
Elsa,Education,Very lag. Always lag at crucial moment,Negative
Elsa,Education,need to include option for hiding crrct answer and reward point after each questn,Negative
Elsa,Education,Seriously a month plan for 8.99? Im good for 3.00 or 2 but c'mon. Also why don't you mention the month plan in here? All I wanted was a quiz game to help me for airframe and powerplant but got stuck with a damn 8.99 bill.,Negative

Elsa,Education,Snowdog Gaming it messed up the game too much. website is much better. I am deleting.,Negative
Elsa,Education,The UI was completely unresponsive. Would only occasionally detect a button press. Missed out on answering a lot of questions because of it. Tried to rejoin but wasn't allowed as the user name was already taken.,Negative
Elsa,Education,It is the worst game ever I could never login so I am leaving a bad review like I am so just just ¤¤¤,Negative
Elsa,Education,the touch buttons are very unresponsive,Negative
Elsa,Education,"The way this tool decides the winner is wrong. Those with less correct answers wins a quiz. Funny tool with bugs. Even if it is a live quiz with timer attached, time should come into play only in the case of tie for those users who answered in time. So going by this game's logic 0 correct answers out of 10 in 1 minute is better than 5 correct answers in 2 minutes within the allotted time of 3 minutes. Many wrong answers in quiz too.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"The app stays in portrait mode which means I can't see the questions, only the coloured boxes to answer. My friend can view in landscape and the questions show on his phone.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"I HATE IT!!! The first time I got this app it was so much fun until today , it suddenly ask for a pattern and the pattern changes EVERY SEVEN MINUTES!!! I really like kahoot , but please don't put the pattern ! Then I will change it to five stars.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"I tried using it in my class and my student experience problems in using it. all of them can't see the question, only choices is available. I tried it again because I belive it is just a simple technical problem but still I can't see the questions only choices is availble. I waisted my time encoding questions.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Useless. If you're thinking of using this for some company quiz, don't bother. Most contestants phone show the wrong question for the one that's being asked on the organiser screen, making it mostly impossible to play.",Negative
Elsa,Education,First when I installed the app it was amazing. But now it's not allowing me to do the quiz only. It is not showing any question. It has become the worst app nowadays. I hope that you will understand my problem and try to resolve it. Please do some bug fixes in the app. I'm very disappointed with this app nowadays!!ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤®,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Terrible. I put in my questions, and was then told that typing answers requires an update to the subscription, but there is no way to upgrade. Why not explain what upgrades you need before purchasing, not after",Negative
Elsa,Education,Worst app ever seen even single star â­ should not be given especially in the case when you are giving a formative assessment or at the time when marks are taken into count.The main problem is we can't handle it on single device as soon as question is popped on the teacher's screen as we are changing tab since no options are available on Kahoot screen only those coloured boxes.Technically it is not feasible giving those coloured boxes instead of options. Worst app one should never use it.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Worlds worst app, quizizz is better than this app as we have to see questions from the hosts screen and answer, while even though quizizz has questions, it has types of musics as well as powerups. Also when I quit to home screen to see the HOSTS SCREEN, IT FREEZES AND WHEN I CLICK ON THE BUTTON IT DOES NOT WORK. REALLY QUIZIZZ IS BETTER",Negative
Elsa,Education,"seems kinda fake. graphics are not realistic at all. not much action, and seemed slow at parts. the story campaign was alright right, although I enjoyed the twist at the end. did not expect Rober Downey Jr. to come in at the end good surprise.",Negative
Elsa,Education,This app sucks when you are on mobile you want to add a picture but then you can only do getty images otherwise you have to download it instead of adding a search bar to find pictures without having to download can you please fix it.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Simply did not work... players could not get the app to display in landscape mode and were unable to see any questions. Seems like this could be awesome, yet it fails to deliver. Multiple reviews note same/similar issues....",Negative
Elsa,Education,It is too much slow and takes a lot Internet,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Never works how it should. Not only does the app just randomly crash, half of the quizes I try to open just don't open.",Negative
Elsa,Education,I did not like I am sitting near to my net which is very fast and your app is telling that it is telling that retrying again and again stupid.,Negative
Elsa,Education,I actually really like this app but I dont like the premium thing •. Technically whats the point if you need premium for 90% of what the app is for. If you want 5 stars from me you'll have to take away the premium’’ðŸ‘Ž I do not recommend ðŸ‘Ž,Negative
Elsa,Education,This app is terrible. You might as well do it online as it constantly tells you you've disconnected. Then it freezes. This app has been constantly sabotaging my grades turning me from an A+ student to a B despite me getting all the answers right.,Negative
Elsa,Education,its too bad always say that your network is bad and the question doesn't show that to be answered please fix the same and it is very glitchy and laggy,Negative
Elsa,Education,It does not allow me to put my own pin so I can play with family.And It was really just if you want to play online and not on the app itself if you want to play on the app and create a draft with your own pin you have to pay.,Negative
Elsa,Education,Better if the questions appeared on my screen as well instead of just answers.. its annoying to keep looking at the other screen,Negative
Elsa,Education,it didnt work. all I could see was shapes I couldnt see the questions!!,Negative

Elsa,Education,Cannot see questions on device. Lag in connectivity affects video meetings and prevents timely answering. Waste of time.,Negative

Elsa,Education,Doesnt even show the question being asked or the answers. Just colored squares. Had to constantly switch between apps just to see what the answer options were. Who makes a quiz app where you cant even see what answer youre choosing?,Negative
Elsa,Education,I really love this app and I finished it really well,Negative
Elsa,Education,the stupid fact the teacher use this as a study crutch is annoying,Negative
Elsa,Education,I Will change my review if you fix the options bug. Where in classic mode only boxes are getting visible. Please fix it I am premium member would love to continue if this major bug is changed.,Negative
Elsa,Education,This is a very bad app¡¡¡¡¡ many technical issues are there..... don't install this app quizziz is better than this app’’’’’.......don't install itðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž.......this only a waste of time‘‘‘‘‘.....I would give this game minus five stars......¡¡¡¡¡ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,Negative
Elsa,Education,I gave it one star because I love kahoot but even time I go into the website I have to make a new account so I decided to download it and when I finished downloading it I was so happy and then it would jest stay on the kahoot screen for hours so I am going to delete it so you should not download itm,Negative
Elsa,Education,I wanted to put a zero bc I got all correct but I keep going down and it takes forever to load and ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I hate this game why did my teachers let us download it ˜­˜­˜     ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬¡¡¡   ,Negative
Elsa,Education,It just dosent work bye,Negative
Elsa,Education,WORST GAME EVER TOO LAGGY WHEN I PRESS AT LEAST 1 BUTTON AND WHEN IN TRAINING I CAN'T TAP IT DOESN'T RESPOND EVEN MY SYSTEM DOESN'T RESPOND TO TAPS,Negative
Elsa,Education,This is a terrible game I don't get how people think this is fun it's just a bunch of stupid quzzes,Negative
Elsa,Education,"This app used to be super convenient. Having the app already there and easy to start up was perfect. But as they saw the opportunity to make some money, they took it. And it is absolutely ridiculous. Everytime I went to enter a game pin THREE different adverts for their new services popped up. And not only that it often times messed it up and I had to reenter the game pin for a second time. Its horrid. Stick to the moblie website. It's much better!",Negative
Elsa,Education,Not worth paying the money. They dont make the plans very obvious. I wanted to upgrade so I opted for the standard plan. Only to discover that the standard plan only allows you to use two types of questions and it'll cost an extra Â£42.49 to upgrade it again for 1 month. A couple of months ago my sister only paid Â£8.99 and could access all features. They dont make it clear that the standard plan is basically useless and you can't do that much more than when you were on the free plan.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"kahoot devs don't respond to enhancement requests, the app purposely puts buttons in confusing places to send you where you don't want to go",Negative
Elsa,Education,It is worst app . it take 10 minutes in opening.,Negative
Elsa,Education,Questions cannot be viewed on phone. Unless the organizers' screen is shown.,Negative
Elsa,Education,you can't see the corresponding answers and questions just colors,Negative
Elsa,Education,"The fee trial is not a free trial as expected. I spent a lot of time creating a quiz to test out the app, now I cannot even play it to test it without subscribing. It is just 14 days free on the subscription which you have to supply you credit card for!! The answers can only be in one line of text, making formatting difficult. The image does not leave much space for the question and answers, so the fonts are tiny, difficult to read and in a horrible font.",Negative
Elsa,Education,It does not show the this that I want,Negative
Elsa,Education,Doesn't work on my Xiomi MI Mix 2. I used it about 1.5 months ago to make questions for a test. It was a good way to study. I got a high score. I had another test about a week ago. I worked on questions for about 1.5 weeks. Made over 300. I tried to play on study mode. It would take me to the quiz screen and freeze. Support was terrible. They offered no advice. They asked me to perform the troubleshooting I'd already tried on my own. After I had told them what I tried- frustrating.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"I was charged incorrectly for the whole year. When I started trial for 7 days, kahoot site informed me that I may be charged for a month. But now I see, my credit card was charged with whole year subscription. I don't want this subscription. I am really poor and it's a big amount for me. Please refund my money as soon as possible. This is very wrongful deed done by kahoot. I was not aware of the fact that you may charge me for the whole year.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"This app is absolute garbage it barely works let alone works at all. We use this for school and it's always glitchy and bad, the most recent case of this is when were doing a quiz on it and I'm first place and on a streak through the entirety of it, then halfway through it says trying to reconnect check your wifi so I check it and guess what FIVE BARS! it finally connects right as the question starts and I click nothing but it says I chose wrong I'm barely scraping the surface here. would rate 0",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Installed, played through a quiz that had 3 questions with incorrect answers, and the service has no system in place for reporting these. Meaning this quiz app is completely useless because any quiz can just have absolute BS answers and you have no way of bringing this to the attention of the people running the service. Ridiculous. It's a basic feature ffs. Get it together Kahoot.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Absolutely the worst game i have ever tried. Yes i can create the quiz, but i cant host it to anyone. I created a 10 question game and tried to host it to others and i couldnt. At first i thought i did something wrong, so i recreated the same questions and answers. It still didnt work. It was really sad to see that all of my effort didnt turn out to be anything. But when i created a 3 question quiz, i could host it really easily. If i cant host 10 question quizes, then why is there the option.",Negative
Elsa,Education,connection is bad,Negative
Elsa,Education,"I accidentally purchased a one year subscription instead of the free trial. I immediately contacted them an hour after the purchase, upon knowing I did the wrong purchase. They would not cancel my subscription and refund me what I paid. They told me to contact Google, but Google said the refund was on merchant's side. Now I have to pay the full amount of a year subscription for an app that I'm not intending to use so much.",Negative
Elsa,Education,It will allow you to put in the work but not tell you until your finished that you cannot create a quiz unless you pay for it. Be straight up and transparent. I'm not paying for a month minimum when I only wanted to create something fun for the kids. It is a one off kind of thing. Sneaky.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Customer service terrible! I ran the 7-day trial decided it wasn't for me so I chose to cancel. I went to my email and used the provided ""Manage Billing"" link and clicked cancel and all was over according to the email I received back. 7 days later I'm charged $120 for the annual fee, I look on the site and found my account still active. I contact Customer support and they tell me I NEVER cancelled even after sending screenshots of my dated cancel confirm! They refuse to refund me, what a scam!",Negative
Elsa,Education,Epic fail. Since I couldn't leave feedback on site that I had accessed webinar where we were engaging in a game of trivia using this God forsaken site/app because window that site was open in closed on me when I tried to leave feedback for it there I am writing to say this was lousy and not user friendly. Not sure why other people on that webinar had no trouble but whatever. Another nice wrinkle to ruin the day and even the weekend.,Negative
Elsa,Education,After a long downloading & install time. The game (PIN:563828) was played on a product launch and stuck on question 6 of 10. Do improve on the game capability before using it publicly especially on electronic product launch which can caused negative impact on the brand. Not even 24 hours but it's time to uninstall. Thank you,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Biggest issue : I wasted hours, and Â£9, creating a quiz for Friday night virtual drinks with friends but some of the questions don't show for some people. That doesn't work for a competitive quiz because it's not equal. Other issues : None of questions show at all on the phone if you choose 'Host Live', so it can't be used for virtual quizzes. So, rather than everyone going through the questions at the same time and chatting about it, everyone has to do it separately instead",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Super annoying. It is impossible to buy a one month license w.o ending up as a subscriber. Kahoot makes this process hard on purpose. Further they make it hard to cancel, I ended up paying for a month I don't need, then found out even finding the settings to terminate was hard. I will not come back to this app. Very, very frustrating!",Negative
Elsa,Education,"The app keeps dropping when I play with the Super Carlin Bros. Constantly timing out whether I get answers correct or incorrect. Not sure why they say there is a 2000 person limit, when it constantly drops players even when they get in. Should definitely change apps until Kahoot's servers can handle the traffic it advertises.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"I loved this app until there was premium. If i dont buy premium, i only can save my quiz in draft and i cant even host my own quiz. While i m making my quiz, i cant put multi select, change points and even most of the pictures must buy premium. So please remove this premium thing. I really dont like to put bad comments but if i have to, i will put. Very pls remove the premium. There r other ways of earning money.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"It is so stupid that you can only play 3 questions in a single round and have to keep clicking to go to the next round. Why can't there be some options in settings, or a settings in general to change it up. It gets so annoying to keep changing it over and over. Also, why can't there be a button for saving and exiting the game?",Negative
Elsa,Education,"would be great, but keeps freezing",Negative
Elsa,Education,"I would rate five stars, but the loading screens in practice are around 7 seconds long after each question. I used this app to help me study, but the loading times feel like sandpaper to the brain. Other than loading times, 5 stars for accessibility and interface.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"What the f****ing app, I wasted a lot of time just making a kahoot and then it got disappeared.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Used to be good! Not anymore! You have to pay just to post a kahoot quiz!! What's the point of having it if I cant use it! I'm so mad! I used to be able to at least post the quizzes without the upgrade but, now the app is useless without premium! Please fix this! ¡",Negative
Elsa,Education,This could have been great but instead turned out to be trying to harvest users through a challenge. I wanted a simple game for family play but it did not work as advertised because the challenge requires everyone to install the app. So I have uninstalled it!,Negative
Elsa,Education,The questions dont appear on time,Negative
Elsa,Education,I purchased this app on a years subscription bearing in mind it had a 14 day free trial. I cancelled the subscription less than 24hrs after setting this app up. It wasn't what I expected. The company still took full payment of 86.99 and have not refunded me a penny. Disgusting. I WANT MY MONEY BACK IN FULL I have consumer rights!!! Just an update got a refund but had to go through Google play. Still should happen automatically you shouldn't be left to chase it. Thanks to kahoot for their guidance,Negative
Elsa,Education,Very slow. Huge delays with what is happening with other people playing. Eg times out before the question is given. Even tried refreshing but no good. The answers time out way before the the others players as well.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"I bought premium Kahoot and it become slower than the free one. After I posted challenge to my students, I cant see how many people hv done it. It didn't update the progress, I can't see their reports. I hope u can fix it immediately, I didn't pay 70 dollar for this poor quality.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"This app won't work I pressed the ""enter pin"" button and everytime its says "" something went wrong sorry for the inconvenience"".I tried restarting my phone I unistalled then redownloaded the app but it said the same thing over and over again do yourself a favor and never ever download this stupid, usless app. I have a test i need to do that is due on Sunday and the teacher put the test on this app how am I to get a grade now thanks alot kaboot .",Negative
Elsa,Education,this game is rigd,Negative
Elsa,Education,This is so stupid it's the worst app ever now to do anything I have to pay premium I already know if I put in my credit card pin to do the free 14-day trial is going to not even tell me that my 14 day trial is done and just charged me and it's just so bad kahoot now is just trying to get so much money just don't download this unless you want to waste your money on something I'm warning you all I used to love this but not anymore this app is only good if you want to waste $14 every month,Negative
Elsa,Education,It was horrible after I played one round it would not let me do anything else not even play another round.,Negative
Elsa,Education,Once you get out by malfunction or anything you can't get back in. All it does is frustrate kids. Add the function to get back in at anytime! Every time this is used same thing happens.,Negative
Elsa,Education,I love this app BUT you shouldn't limit the characters! It's a great way to study but our harder questions tend to be longer than the characters allowed! Please change that and I'll be more than glad to change it to 5 stars,Negative
Elsa,Education,"The base a idea of group quizzing/trivia is good, but the fundamentals are flawed. This has out grown the idea of a learning/classroom app and should either make a social trivia version or stay the same and be devoured in the most capitalistic way by another, superior app.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Flat out doesn`t work. Can`t run the game from my tablet, it forces a tab open in google chrome, which is where i have to run the game from. Problem with this is that the images accompanying the quiz do not display when im running from the chrome mobile browser. I need to run from the tablet because that is what is hooked up to the display.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Stressing, people with slow computers or devices are extremely angry not just at the device but the creator for being a unsmart person BECAUSE THERE IS A DONE BUTTON WHEN YOUR ABOUT TO GET A REWARD, AND WHAT DOES THE DONE BUTTON DO, GIVE YOU NOTHING FOR JUST HARD WORK! SO one star and because the game lets you type anything with no filter, i did not try myself or anyone but still NO FILTER=BAD WORDS, and you will be left of with a unsafe game ;-; and a stressful on",Negative
Elsa,Education,This is very good qiz and giving opportunity to all thank you soo much for giving talllent,Negative
Elsa,Education,"This is the the worse app I've ever seen. I can't login and I can't contact with customer service. I can't create a new account and when I try lost password, it did not work any time. I swear I changed my password 6 times and It didnt work. Any Kahoot employe can contact me ? ¡",Negative
Elsa,Education,Does not let you host a demo quiz to test out the real time performance before buying a membership. I suggest everyone get a Quizizz membership like my company opted for because they let you demo a few quizzes before deciding to buy it.,Negative
Elsa,Education,Dis is trash everytime you want to change your username it goes back to your old username can you FIX this game where you csn change your username,Negative
Elsa,Education,"ZERO STARS! it never allows me to actually play! I've downloaded the app multiple times, I've tried to just play using the browser, every time it lets me enter the pin and once I do it says i need to download the app!! BUT I ALREADY HAVE??? when it actually works its a great game.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"It has the worst server !!! You can never enter a game pin at all in any case , at any internet speed ! It has the most unreliable connection gateway. Quite disappointed with the experience.",Negative
Elsa,Education,This game is a pice of thrash it was so to create a game so i would not recommend it at all,Negative
Elsa,Education,"The most frustrating and confusing quiz app ever. Kicked us out of the game twice before we actually managed to join. Many correct answers come out as incorrect, despite your answer matching perfectly with what the app displays as the correct answers. Sometimes it even times out before the question has ended. The scores make no sense and there is no cohesion with how your points are collated. So many bugs, it's absolutely absurd.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Firstly it works very good but later I had been waiting since 1 hour to give the Ans but it was stuck at first qns after it does not work I got 0 mark because of this hell is happening still it does not work ,I did uninstall and then install again but no use .",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Can't really take Kahoot seriously as a quiz platform let alone a learning tool when you can't even switch off the atmosphere destroying, highly distracting, dreadful Casio synth music that automatically plays at full volume with every quiz whether you like it or not. Given that Kahoot is rolling out weekly updates and that users have been begging for this feature for months now this fully deserves its 1 star rating as a result.",Negative
Elsa,Education,Very terrible and stupid app. Never ever works even though my internet connection is very stable. Cuts you off in the middle of a game. Waste of data. No stars at all,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Absolutely awful, dont waste your time with this app. I'd give it less then one star if I could. You're time would be better spent just on facetime with your friends and having a pen and paper quiz. Avoid this app at all costs!!!!",Negative
Elsa,Education,This is so bad you cant no longer pick your own name 1 star,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Terrible connection. The last two games I've played using this app it has lost connection in the middle of it and made me lose important games that affected my grade. I won't be using this app anymore, I recommend just going to the website.",Negative
Elsa,Education,I paid for the monthly subscription and it didn't reflect on the app maybe due to connection issues. Then I went for the yearly subscription on the app which has 7 days free trial and my money was deducted immediately too. Where's the 7 days?????. Please I need my money for the yearly subscription refunded and my monthly subscription activated immediately.,Negative
Elsa,Education,answering sometimes lags,Negative
Elsa,Education,"God awful app which is unoptimized for Android. When you try tapping more than one time after the countdown is over this ridiculous game freezes, so you lose points. It's ridiculous, DO NOT recommend this app for hosting school/university quizzes.",Negative
Elsa,Education,You debited almost everything from my account. All money I had was given by the government for my basic needs to survive this pandemic. I tried to login a day prior to cancel my subscription but I was enable to login. Please refund my amount I don't have anything to survive this pandemic. I have also lost my job. Please think about me. There won't be any option left than to do sucideas I don't have anything in my account through which I can survive.,Negative
Elsa,Education,This game makes you really enraging everytime you hop into a game then get it wrong a few times it would say 'no one would say it was easy :)' i am very enraged with this app,Negative
Elsa,Education,When you try to login it doesnt work! It says sorry incorrect and then the screen goes black. And when you try to upload a pic... impossible tje screen turns white. So FRUSTRATING!!!!!!,Negative
Elsa,Education,SO CHIP AND 3D QUALITY PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL ALWAYS HANG PLEASE DO NOT UNINSTALL VERY USELESS I FILL TO GIVE THIS APP SO BAD REVIEW .THIS APP SO NOT BE THE APP,Negative
Elsa,Education,Takes to long to load then want work,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Installed for son school can't see the questions on screen only colour squares... Tried on 3 devices, samsung mobile, tablet and apple iPhone apps and online... Fix it and it should be a great learning tool to reinforce kids homework",Negative
Elsa,Education,"You cant switch between apps in the midst of a game. And there is no solution to log back in, recover your points and answers. Very frustrating",Negative
Elsa,Education,I rate 1 star because its laggy and it kept saying sorry. it's taking a few extra seconds to load. I have been patient and when I checked my clock it has been 1 hour,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Worst, horrible experience! The app has absolutely no way to restore lost Kahoots you've spent hours working on. I lost one because of a syncing issue and it just disappeared without a trace!! No trash bin, recovery folder, draft anywhere!! Horrible, non intuitive app. Seems like a really basic thing to go so wrong with.",Negative
Elsa,Education,Useless for remote play. Why aren't the options visible to all the participants?? Open ur mind a little bit and make this available and huge boom will be there as currently majority are working from home.,Negative
Elsa,Education,It is one of the worst app ever please dont install it if there is no star rating i can give zero star i have exam on this app during lockdown and this app is not working i am so angry with this app i have 1.5 gb data also available all other things like youtube whatsapp can work perfectly but this app is still not working i can start this app on 3 other phones but there is no working on that phone also,Negative
Elsa,Education,I spent hours making a kahoot only to find out I am too young to send it to my friends. I am using this as revision and our test is next week.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"My sister's and I live very far away and thought this would be fun, but the questions only show up for the host during a live game. Everyone else can only see colors. Pretty bummed.",Negative
Elsa,Education,Wrost app ever seen. You cant handle it with one device because of there will be only option with some signs and answer will be on hoster screen.When you are going to mark answer time will end .Don't install,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Hi Kahoot team, your app is very good for students, teachers, lectures and professor but my objection is when we login with first time which phone or name. Don't allow them play repeat or again. It will stole real genius. It's my request. I hope it will solve early. Thank you",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Useless for remote hosting or video calls. Ok if you're in a classroom with a large screen but useless if people cant see the answers on their devices, just dumb symbols! Shame.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Not working in Android 5.0, it just freeze when starts.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Issues with no communication I have purchased a Â£10.99 monthly account to hold quizzes for my furlough team to stay in contacted. Used once and now can't use again saying ""need to use premium"" and buy again. Emailed with no reply, i have proof of money leaving my account and subscription. Fast at taking your money but not helpful if any issues. Do not purchase from them.",Negative
Elsa,Education,Waste of time unless you're in the same room. Questions dont show up on people's screens it only shows up on one. Wasted hours.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Ok so I've been trying to get in this app for an hour and it still hasn't loaded. Worst ""app"" more like loading screen ever",Negative
Elsa,Education,They said you will have a plus feature for 14 days for free if you entered your credit card once I entered the card they deducted the full amount for 1 year and when I sent for cancellation they said enjoy the app for one year...really desperate from the app and their service,Negative
Elsa,Education,Unable to play with others. After I enter the pin and answer required questions I get a message saying You've disconnected and it's trying to reconnect me.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Editor decent but impossible to play or test. Clicking Play on desktop forces you to download an app to test. Creating an account just leads to a page saying ""You're in! See your nickname on screen?"" with no button or link to proceed. Wasted hours creating a quiz which I cannot test.",Negative
Elsa,Education,I made a 60 question Star Wars quiz that took hours to make only to find out when I was finished I need to pay 6 dollars a month to start a Kahoot game. Thanks Kahoot for wasting my time...,Negative
Elsa,Education,Didn't show any questions...times out because I didn't answer the questions I couldn't see..???,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Customer Svc is awful. I failed to cancel my membership during the trial period. As soon as I was able, I asked for a refund. I was wrong and did receive a 50% refund. But what I didn't like was the attitude I received from Robert with billing. He was rude and condescending. I will not return as a result of my interactions with him. I'll move on to quizizz. TY",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Used this app for a live trivia event and there were so many problems. The system crashed a few times, it may have been hacked. 0 stars.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"If you let your phone go to sleep or switch to another app, Kahoot will lose your connection to the quiz, and it may take 1+ minutes to reconnect. By then, you're already out. That's pretty awful!",Negative
Elsa,Education,Asks you to pay over Â£100 just to make and play your own quiz. is this a joke why did it not tell me that i had to pay to play otherwise i would not have spent 3 hours pointlessly making a quiz which i could not play unless i paid a subscription. A f****** subscription for a quiz app what idiot would pay a subscription for something so stupid u can get completely free elsewhere i could name you a few apps right now that does the same job but i dont have too. just look up quiz apps in playstore.,Negative
Elsa,Education,This app is bad because you shall choose other version or app version! You cheat my quiz¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ when i create i need to choose other version or app version i want to play this app! If i delete this app i am sad˜­­ please fix this app so i can rate 5 stars,Negative

Elsa,Education,You can make quizzes but costs $9 a month,Negative
Elsa,Education,"It won't let me use the study section, everytime I start it does the beginning of the song and stops just leaving me on the first question.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Your latest update is terrible! My students didn't like the characters they had to select - because you didn't give an option for real or fake names. And, the app began before everyone signed in. Needless to say that the quiz was a disaster... And, no one liked it! •",Negative
Elsa,Education,Less useful than Jeremy Corbyn at a bahmitzva. For quizzes it's forever crashing and timing out. Back to pen and paper before I put a bullet through my phone in frustration.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"My friend, who is on iPhone, recommended this app because she can create and share quizzes for FREE without subscription. so why is it different for Android?",Negative
Elsa,Education,The questions only appear in the creator of the game. None for the participants.,Negative

Elsa,Education,I gave this a 1 star because its glitchy,Negative
Elsa,Education,"To be rated educational, some quizzes should be fact checked first before releasing. For example: there are no 50 countries in Europe as stated in one of the quizzes...",Negative
Elsa,Education,This is the worst quiz app ever I you cannot see the question not the options while playing the game which make the app of no use while playing a quiz The presenter has to share their screen with everyone or else we can never play the quiz properly,Negative
Elsa,Education,It has some problem when I have to open it takes so many time and when I open another app and get back to it with some time it disappers,Negative

Elsa,Education,"Bots, bots everywhere... Can't use this platform, bots crashes the game. Known issue for a while, but devs 0 response.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Tried to launch a challenge. Nothing happens, regardless of whether I click a link or enter PIN. Can't set homework if my own phone can't load it. Back to Google Forms.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"It takes so long to load that patience is lost and in the middle of the game it hangs up , when restarted ,it restarts from 1st question So answers are known Accuracy must be check at end So that atleast re entry will not affect result",Negative
Elsa,Education,"possibly one of the most boring games i've ever played. plus, it has many limits that ruin the experience. if your a teacher reading this, dont force it upon everyone, cause i can guarantee you some students will dislike kahoot. and if you dont have a projector, you wont be able to play it. for some reason the students have to read the questions off the board and not their own devices. for now, kahoot is a joke, wouldn't recommend it, although theres lots of other people that like it.",Negative
Elsa,Education,There are some problems with the options. I pressed the right one but the one showned and recorded is not and notifying me I'm wrong. THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR VALID ASSESSMENT.,Negative
Elsa,Education,I signed up for free trial and then monthly subscription. So why is a whole year taking out of my account! THIS IS ABSURD!,Negative

Elsa,Education,"I had an account so I tried to log in and it said my email wasnt with an account. so I tried to make another account using the email, as well as 2 others, and it said those emails were unavailable because they all have accounts with them. I only have one account on Kahoot.",Negative
Elsa,Education,Needs per review. There is incorrect information in this app. It is about the effectiveness of wearing masks to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. The app states that a mask won't keep you safe from catching the virus then states that if you have the virus wearing a mask will prevent you from transmitting it to others. I have not taken many quizzes so I can't say if they contain incorrect or confusing and misleading information or not. Please review the information posted in your app.,Negative
Elsa,Education,The timer goes down a lot faster than iPhone (it runs down all the way to the left at 10 seconds) and answer steaks don't work either on Android.,Negative

Elsa,Education,EXTREMELY LAAAAAG. KAHOOT TIMER IS NOT IN SYNC WITH GMEET. WASN'T ABLE TO JOIN THE QUIZBOWL BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM. ¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤¤,Negative
Elsa,Education,"When i share m'y kahoot to m'y students it doesn't show automaticly and thÃ© students have to have an account ,to SIGN UP. .As a guest they can't do thÃ© practice because thÃ© game diesn't work.And they Can see thÃ© answers without pla ying.I Lost 28 euro s juste for nothing.The sharing link is worthless and should lead directly to thÃ© game otherwise it has no meaning.The students are confused and they dont find any game.They clic to thÃ© classic and nothing is showing !!I I want m'y money back",Negative
Elsa,Education,It didn't work it said I was disconnected!!¡     ,Negative
Elsa,Education,I really didnt like this app bscause it kept asking for a acount and stuff,Negative
Elsa,Education,so fun i school and in zoom it help so much,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Its deleted my work, a school assignment that was due that ilI had in draft. Customer service is slow but they replied over time.They couldn't help me though. I was very upset due to this. I tried making a account but it was giving me too much trouble, saying I already had a account when i didnt. An when i tried to sign in it said they had no accounts like that one after saying they did. think something is wrong with the app.",Negative
Elsa,Education,I would suggest not to install this app.. It keeps crashing.. And tbh it also creates Rivalry between ur frnds..,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Because I'm registered as a ""student"", whenever I send a PIN to anyone to do one of my Kahoots, the questions and answers aren't visible. Who the hell cares if you're a student or not? I just want my friends to do a quiz I worked hard on. I woul say good things but the only good parts about Kahoot require a SUBSCRIPTION!",Negative
Elsa,Education,This rating is for the app itself. It's stuck on me being the learner even though I have changed the settings on the website to teachers dashboard. Considering that we're planning on using Khan Academy Math for homeschooling purposes I would even have preferred the parent dashboard over the learners dashboard. With this being said I find this app to be difficult to use / navigate. If possible help me resolve this issue and I will change my rating. Thank you in advance.,Negative
Elsa,Education,Disappointing.. unless your child is a competent reader at 5/6 its quite pointless doing maths for example..and the calculator is upside down..where are calculators upside down? The dumbing down of our children continues..if this is the best they have to offer I'll stick to homeschooling old skool..no Prussian system indoctrination for mine thanks.,Negative
Elsa,Education,Khan academy sucks whenever you get an awnser wrong on the unit test it makes you go back one levelon that skill wich sucks. They also don't describe what have to dovery well and srewing me up often wich is rare for me in real school on work sheets. This is why I hate khan academy.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"This helped me so much with understanding math, But i do have some complains PLEASE do something about these :) 1. Speed is slow It takes like 5 seconds to load the page, and another 5 second to load the test which is very very very ANNOYING, i keep closing the question tab by clicking outside of the tab accidentally.. and then i have to wait againt o resume the test and rechoose or rewrite my answers.. Why is that even a thing? 2. No DarkMode ??!? I cant look at the screen for more than 1 second because of its brightness.. This great app and site REALLY needs Dark mode! it has been suggested before but there is no dark mode yet?? I couldn't understand math, no one would help me learn math, the teachers and my parents would try to explain me but i couldn't understand. But Khanacademy helped me alot! i still learning algebra 1 but everyday i face these problems so many times that i makes me quit trying.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"This is not a good aap all shape of mirror, lenses ect all are wrong I mean very disappointed from this app. This app is not deserve a half star according to me ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡",Negative
Elsa,Education,The app is really good but the only problem is it does not teach you everything for High School Elementary kindergarten first grade and Cetera that would be a very helpful that the application can get us ready for college or for beginners that does not learn any mathematics there's a lot of people that does not know how to do any math for example like me this is my first time learning I used to be in life skills special class for kids they don't teach us math they think it is too advanced for us,Negative
Elsa,Education,"This was the worst educational app I have ever used ... it is so pathetic, there are educational vids that don't even make sense to mii half of the time I have to search for the topics on YouTube, this app wasted 1 month of my time ... all those reading this review please do not download this app ... its the worst ðŸ˜«ðŸ¤§ðŸ¤®",Negative
Elsa,Education,There is no way one can give feedback/review of videos for improvements. Because there are many topics which are poorly explained and need a lot of improvements. The teachers are not explaining in a proper way which in turn causes students to lose interest. Feedback option on every video is necessary.,Negative
Elsa,Education,This app is good but I am not able to see my progress report . It always shows an error.,Negative
Elsa,Education,Every time I try to sign it it keeps saying there is an issue.,Negative
Elsa,Education,I might have give 5 stars. I installed the app and when I opened the app it shows a white screen and then closes the app I tried uninstalling and then restarted my phone and installed again but the same thing happened,Negative
Elsa,Education,The video always gets stuck in the middle,Negative
Elsa,Education,BRING BACK OLD BIO COURSE!! the new one is confusing and the quizzes don't even make sense cause you don't learn the answers in the videos,Negative

Elsa,Education,Why can I sign in on the web but not the app? Keep getting message there was a problem signing me in.,Negative
Elsa,Education,When trying to log in it automatically force closes the application. There's no way to even use it.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Imma Kid And This App That I WAS FORCED TO INSTALL IS DRIVING ME CRAZY Somethings Are Good ( Educational, History ) BUT SOME ( MULTIPLICATION, DIVISION ) IS MAKING ME OUTRAGE. Example: 7 TIMES 6,000. WHAT THE- ( Please Dont Take It Too Seriously Maybe This Isnt My Kind Of App )",Negative
Elsa,Education,This app is absolutely idiotic. First it tells me 0.1 isnt 1/10 then on another lesson every question had 2 of the same answer and said I was wrong I didnt pick the right out of the 2,Negative
Elsa,Education,I downloaded this for my test preparation and I am making an account but an unexpected error is not letting me what is wrong with it I am tired of trying again and again ðŸ˜­,Negative

Elsa,Education,Keeps on closing when I try to log in with my Google account,Negative
Elsa,Education,The app keeps not loading and crashing,Negative
Elsa,Education,I hate this app if i could rate it 0 star i would when i click on the app first it enters and then exits by itself so do not waste your time downloading this app it is useless,Negative
Elsa,Education,Not working at all. Unable to load content...,Negative
Elsa,Education,Khan Academy was the best thing to happen to learning since public schools. Now there isn't even a step one. What happened?,Negative
Elsa,Education,"There's nothing on the subject Home Economic. Home economics, or family and consumer sciences, is today a subject concerning human development, personal and family finance, housing and interior design, food science and preparation, nutrition and wellness, textiles and apparel, and consumer issues. Can you help? I need help in that.",Negative
Elsa,Education,No soo much helpful app . Nothing more than ncert solutions. It doesn't contain video lectures of 11 and 12 class,Negative
Elsa,Education,Its horrible it is not letting me sign in it signed me out and I saved my password this is not a good app please do another app if you don't want to waste your time,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Well, the app fails to launch when I try to open it. Could somebody please help? I'll change my rating if someone gets back to me",Negative
Elsa,Education,"The worst learning app I've ever seen . My son used this app for 6 months still he is getting low marks , he start getting low marks when he downloaded this app . In class 1 he is getting 96/100 but now in class 10 he is getting 31/100 . My son lost his six months by using this app . Needed too much improvement .",Negative

Elsa,Education,There should be a mute button for videos....,Negative
Elsa,Education,Hi Khan academy it is a good app but there is an problem I can't use it when I try it saying as account error,Negative
Elsa,Education,"I thought it was going to be in app not bounce me to web browser where I can't watch the videos because they get cut off on the side of the screen. Also how's that work with answering questions? Or working on programming with the type window and display window? Edit: The developer clearly doesn't understand. I was expecting a closed environment on mobile, not a shunt to web.",Negative
Elsa,Education,Fail. Khan Academy could at least try to apply scientific method to their science classes and tests.,Negative
Elsa,Education,Very bad. You have no course to end.So join will have fun for a few days but there will be no classes later. Sir's words and work are like sky- Land. Please think and join. ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™ðŸ™,Negative
Elsa,Education,"This sucks a lot because i am forced to do 2 hours of khan academy everyday, and all i wanted was to see my progess report. Why do you suck now? The old progess report would always show your progess in 10 seconds but this one TAKES 20 MINUTES",Negative
Elsa,Education,"I really, really appreciate the website version of this, and thought that a mobile version would benefit me more. However, when I try to actually open a lesson, be it document, quiz, or video, the app crashes. I've tried signing out, clearing the cache, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, and still nothing has changed. Earlier today I sent my crash report to you. I would appreciate an explanation or a solution as I would like to use the app! Thank you!",Negative
Elsa,Education,"I always have high hopes for Khan Academy. On YouTube it's nice to be able to search a video to help my kids with their learning. But the UI is unsatisfactory every time. 5 minutes after I set up a new account for my son, Khan Academy sends the email to finalize the account but won't let me access that website. When I try to simply sign into the account it doesn't recognize the password, try to reset the password, it says the account doesn't exist. Stuff like this happens EVERY TIME. ðŸ¤·ðŸ¾â€â™€ï¸",Negative
Elsa,Education,"A wonderful foundation. But the app have problems: I've downloaded items of bookmarks and still not shown while I'm offline, the app is really slow even if I'm online or offline, sometimes it closes by itself, when i try to scroll on algebra (all sections) it lags and glitches a lot preventing me to enter a specific part of lessons. I've used this app 10 months ago, but i didn't have so much problems like now. I hope you fix these problem ASAP. 5 stars for the academy. 0 stars for the app.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"I just got the app. Spent 2 hours doing a course theory text in geometry. It crashed atleast 5 times but let me resume on a different question around where I was in question order. Then I get to the final question, I get it wrong and it crashes again. This time restarting the entire test as if I'd never taken it. No info on how I did or anything. So frustrating. I would love to give this a great rating and I was really excited. Please look into this.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Update removed scratchpad! We use this regularly in our house, but we are all used to being able to make notes or write out problems in the Khan scratchpad. It was essential. We have had to break out notebooks because the latest update removed the ability to use the scratchpad in a math problem. The button is no longer there. I didn't see removing this feature in the release notes either. Very disappointing.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"I have been using khan academy for years now, there are some great lessons that makes learning easy. Yet there are a lot of lessons that make me angry and upset. I watch the videos and do as told yet when I got to the question its doing it in a different way with no real explanation. Khan Academy has its ups and down but be aware of the fact that many students and parents are upset and stressed do to the app.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"One simple feature would make it 5 stars. Allow me to put videos on an sd card. I can't believe that this isn't a feature already; that's a standard thing. Almost all of my apps already support that. I was astounded when I found out that this app doesn't support putting downloads onto mounted sd cards. This will stay 1 star until this is added, because otherwise I'll just watch on my computer and save battery power and data.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"The website is great, but this app is useless. Not a single exercise loads, they all show a ""Error making task progress"" message. And YES, I already tried uninstalling and reinstalling it like you recommend to all the people complaining below. Has that actually fixed it for anyone? Is there a single phone that this app actually works properly on? I guess the only option is to use the site (which is slower), or maybe there's an older version of the app that actually works properly?",Negative
Elsa,Education,"I rarely write reviews, if ever, and I had high expectations for this app. Don't get me wrong, Khan academy is a very informational website, good for learning. The app however is very buggy and glitchy, deletes my progress every few minutes and makes me restart, saying ""Error Making Task Progress"". Nothing wrong with my internet connection, just the app. If the app is fixed, I will change my review. Until then, save yourselves the headache and frustration and just use the website. Disappointed.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"I had this app eons ago and it worked. I just downloaded today it none of the courses are loading to due being ""unable to connect"", despite the fact that I'm in the very room where the Internet source is AND I've turned mobile data. Both cylinders running, the courses don't even try to load. I'll stick with the desktop version until this is fixed.",Negative
Elsa,Education,In this app i want each country and their own language that is for ex i am an indian and i belongs to Andhra pradesh state and my mother tongue is telugu and i want to get teaching in my own mother tongue so plzz attach all the languages,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Would really like to give it more stars but it won't even open on my android phone. I've tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it several times and it's still crashing before it even opens. I hope you guys can roll out some bug fixes on the next update, but I'm not even able to use it so I'm uninstalling it for now. I'm still able to use khan academy through the browser on my computer. But it would be nice to have it available on my phone. Update: still doesn't work. :(",Negative
Elsa,Education,You love stealing a my whole day why do you like it? I am never allowed to use any other things and only Khan academy. You like seeing kids being annoyed by your app? You steal all my time the games always say do Khan academy I hate this app,Negative
Elsa,Education,"I'm a regular user and love this app but over the last day or so it wouldn't let me open the app and kept crashing. Now that I can open the app it keeps telling me to sign in or telling me I ""dont have any recent lessons"" which is making me nervous thinking it might have lost my progress. When I click on the lessons (exp. History) it says ""lesson can't be loaded, check network"" I'm on 4g and my signal is fine so I'm thinking it's a bug. I'd love for this to be fixed, It's my main schooling!",Negative
Elsa,Education,"This app is very good for learning. But there may be something wrong please make changes for the wrong happening. When I am trying to get a quiz or tests given by our school, at that time this application is showing that """"""""error making progress"""""""""" I don't understood what they wanted to say. ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜‘",Negative
Elsa,Education,"just installed the app. Had clicked on practice, and a pop-up ""Error making task progress. We encountered an error while attempting to make progress in this task; please try again later"" appeared. I waited, and tried again. Repeated the wait and try approach, a few more times. Received the same pop-up each time. Can't give more stars until I know what the app does, other than a pop-up error. (Not going to try uninstalling and reinstalling) If the app works later, more stars. If same issue...",Negative
Elsa,Education,"I can log in from my laptop, but every time I try to log in from my tablet it says password incorrect. BS! I'm very careful typing it. I changed it. Same result. I uninstalled and reinstalled. Same result. Your app is broken! TO YOUR 05/06/2019 REPLY: You didn't read my review, because I was clear I'd already tried that. Also, I was able to install and login from phone, so only tablet is problem. ""This app is compatible with all of your devices."" Really?",Negative
Elsa,Education,Until the most recent update everything was working well. But now whenever I view any course I can watch the videos but when I got to take a subject or unit test the page comes up blank except for the green lightbulb icon. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling to no avail.,Negative
Elsa,Education,This app may be good but it's not like that what I want. I want to take solution of my text book problems like let me take a pic of my textbook numerical problems and sending that and immediately taking a detailed explanation of that solution. It should be free and if there is video lectures that will be great. Is like this type of any app for bcom final year then please inform me,Negative
Elsa,Education,"This app was not for me, thats all i can say, it says 'you can learn anything' well you can't, its mainly about history, maths and science. This was 100% not what i was looking for, if you want to learn about a small range of topics this could be for you, but it just didn't do it for me, all the video's when really YouTube has many more learning resources",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Changing my rating from 4 to 1, the new search function is terrible. Before it was quick and efficient to go through the years in a curriculum. Now I have to go here and there,select this and that, it's become tedious. Want to rollback to old update !!!",Negative
Elsa,Education,"the app crashes when i try to open the semiconductors's glossary which as of now i can't find directly in the app but as i had watched those earlier, i still have an option to go back to them through the recent activity section but as soon as i click the the app crashes no matter that the content is available and the one video is still playing but what use it is of if i can't watch the desired video. please see to it asap. p. s: - both the physics(class XI india) and class 12 india are nowhere",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Man does this app annoy me. Not only is it a pain to search stuff and find what you want, but it's a pain to download the lessons( it only downloads the videos. Not the articles to go with it. Smh man couldn't you make this actually useful) and it takes a heck of a lot of time to download the videos, which if I search on YouTube for the same exact videos and download them, it's a matter of seconds. I don't know why this app is so clunky and awkward to use. But please fix it.",Negative
Elsa,Education,Tests randomly stop recognizing that you've entered an answer. Leaving the Check button disabled and unable to continue. Closing and reopening the app doesn't help. Reinstalling didn't help. Fortunately the web developers got it right. Used firefox and was able to continue answering questions without issue on the website.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"This app is great for reviewing maths until you try any quizzes involving the evaluation of exponents, it doesn't allow you to answer as there is no option to type anything that remotely resembles a multiplication symbol (x, *, â€¢ are all not options.) This wouldn't be so irritating if it weren't for the fact that I got the app solely because the website has the same problem, and the support team seems to not read feedback reports from users as I have received no response back.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"When I first dicovered that Khan Academy had an app, I was over the moon. I was so used to the websitr and I loved that. But then I got really disapointed because it would not even install. This is a humongous disapointment. Either fix this or pull it down. I am sorry Khan Academy but this is not good.",Negative
Elsa,Education,It worked fine until one day it just wouldnt connect. I tried reinstalling and now it wont let me log in,Negative
Elsa,Education,"The app is great ,very wide info but i have a problem accessing the video lessons,,everytime it stops working when i try to load the videos . I tried ur troubleshooting stuff of uninstalling and reinstalling the app but its only a waste of time It crashes MORE and MORE.Its supposed to be a learning app for everyone ,even if the android version is not updated...wth!!!",Negative
Elsa,Education,Answers labeled incorrect when the entered answer is the exact answer the app states it is. I thought I just couldn't remember any math instead of just having gaps. The videos are helpful when the problem structure in the video matches the one presented for solving.,Negative
Elsa,Education,This app is very good as compared to others there are test after completion of every topic and also revision test but one thing is that the language in which that person speaks in the videos is English but he speaks it likes that it isn't understandable even after turning on the captions. But yes if you downloaded this app for learning computer science it's the best but if for learning your course so you can face the above problem,Negative
Elsa,Education,this was wow..but the new update made things work slower.consuming soo much time to losd a thing.opens web browsers to select courses etc.prev one is better with an attractive display and easy to find everything.And when searching need to give everything correct.its not fixed even with tye jew update.i loved this but the new update is not tyat good.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"I appreciate Khan Academy and all that Sal and the team do for us with learning. Sadly, this app is not intuitive. As someone who prides myself on being both a teacher and a student in Khan Academy, I am finding that being able to use the app on the teacher side does not work. I will continue to use Khan academy for my students, my children and myself and will hope that the app will get better for the teaching side.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"What the hell it's not opening the app and taking me back to the home page even after several attempt I am not able to open the app Edit: I have tried all the steps which you have written before only. There are 3 icons below of home, search and bookmark when it was on home it says unfortunately Khan academy has stopped and when I tapped the search button and searched videos I was able to access everything but the problem is takes me back to homepage when it is at home bar. Regards",Negative
Elsa,Education,"I can tell that this app was made by people from top colleges like MIT because it makes me want to kill myself. The UI is atrocious, and there is no way to delete progress so if you mess up or mis-click (often because of UI) then you are stuck with that mistake and it constantly nags and mocks you about it.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"The recent UI update on march 28, 2019 has made using the app considerably more difficult. A lot of the time when you tap something you either get no response or a response after 10 seconds. Assignments take ages to load and many times I have found myself tapping things multiple times because of no response.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"I used Khan Academy before and I just have to say, I'm really disappointed at how buggy it is nowadays. My downloads are paused. I turned off my data for a second and the app crashed.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"I was really looking forward to trying this app. But, none of the practices or quizzes load. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but there was no difference. If anything, the app crashed more. 1) My name is not David. 2) I installed the current version 5.2.3 available for download.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Very unresponsive app.. I often have a hard time scrolling down because the app doesn't respond, tapping buttons rarely has any effect, etc... It works perfectly on my computer but the app on mobile needs a lot of work.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"the first time i installed the app, it wouldn't log me in and even after it did, it wouldn't let me use it i.e it wouldn't load any of the courses even though the data connection was on. so i figured that it must be switched onto wifi connection only, but it wasn't. then i tried reinstalling the app. this time it wouldn't log me in AT ALL. saying that there was an issue in logging in with the google account. i tried all the other options but it still wouldn't give me access.",Negative
Elsa,Education,I do not like this app because really what happens if they don't even help you try to help you they just make you do it I have better apps that I could teach children my childrenmy daughter really hate that I did it's making her like so disappointed that she has to do work and she loves work so you shouldn't really get this app is good if your children understand it and take their time on it but I just don't like it for 7 8 year olds summit year olds could do it but just not mine,Negative
Elsa,Education,since the new update there is a delay between me clicking on the video and it starting. and now it does not automatically go to the next in a series of videos. it also take a lot time to download besides having a very fast Internet connection ðŸ˜• please help.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"At first, I tried use the website: wouldn't load anything. Then i installed this app in hopes to get my Calculus done, but this won't load either. It says that I need to check my connection and try again. I have internet access and it still won't let me. I even tried uninstalling the app and restarting my router, but nothing will works. Please fix!",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Thought this was a great app until there was a ""trick question"" and by that i mean it had 2 answeres to select from that were 100% identical (and correct) but the first one i selected was ""wrong"" even though it matched the ""correct"" answer exactly. Now i dont know if i trust this app at all.",Negative
Elsa,Education,It's getting buggier with every update. Requires a complete overhaul. Especially the video player. It cannot be that hard to design a bug free player. Edit: Tried reinstalling multiple times--didn't work. I've tried the app on other android devices but the results were no different from that of my phone. It's a broken app.,Negative
Elsa,Education,The app has gone buggy! I can't even open it. I have downloaded the app before and this the first time it's been like this. I tap on the app and it opens a white browser then goes back to my home screen.,Negative
Elsa,Education,The app is great but it seems to crash when I open it since I have updated it. Please fix it. I have already uninstall and install it again hoping it would properly function again but none of those methods work.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"This apps seems to be in no way connected to the online version. Nothing is synced when logging in using the same account, rendering it useless. The website is wonderful, but the app simply does not function as it should.",Negative
Elsa,Education,This app is SO stupid and SO BORING! It's not fair how your other app for little kids looks at least decent while ours is SO boring!!!,Negative
Elsa,Education,"It has no features, one can't even save a page for offline viewing, you can't highlight and copy a text from it to your MsWord, no option to download page, poor search engines. It needs serious upgrades. I nevertheless appreciate the quality of information I get from it. But the app is not worth it.",Negative
Elsa,Education,I use this app souly for math because we need to do it for school. We have to do 25% each quarter of the school year. You'd think that would be enough time right? For some it is and for people like me it isn't. I have friends that go up 5% in a half hour and finished their whole quarter early. People like me who are unlucky cant seem to go up 1% in a full hour. This website favors certain users and it's really annoying. Now the quarter is almost over and I only have 28 out of 50 done. Thanks Khan,Negative
Elsa,Education,"I Wasn't even able to use it. Since I installed the app, I wasn't able to open it even once because it keep crashing. It would even load. I like Khan academy; it's great, but my experience with the app is not good.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Assignments don't load, crashes upon opening some tasks too. This plays an important part of my maths course and now I'll be criticized for not using this. When the app is at fault. Uninstalled then reinstalled and the error persists.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"The app always shows that I am offline despite being online and the Internet in a Working condition. Even after multiple uninstalls and phone restarts, the app still says, I am Offline. Its very annoying and am Unable to use all the features of learning available in this app.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"This app is awful. It teaches you nothing and made me even more depressed than I already was. I was forced to use it for school's e learning, and the assignments were nothing like what I was taught, and the explanations didn't make any sense.",Negative
Elsa,Education,It is pure ass. I put correct answers even backed up by the Web and it gives me it wrong. Also you can't stop and restart the lesson once you get something wrong forcing you to go through the wrong lesson. One of the worst learning apps. I do not recommend.,Negative
Elsa,Education,This app is rubbish! It insists that 7.4689 rounded to the nearest tenth is not 7.5 The site should document how the calculator is used since the app does not. Well neither the site or the app provide information. All this and repeated crashes too.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Why does it crash when loading before you have a practice quiz? It's irritating, I spend hours going through your videos, I understand very well and eager to test my understanding but it keeps on telling me to 'try again later' so FRUSTRATING ðŸ˜¤",Negative
Elsa,Education,This app is very good and explanatery it makes learning easy for me and the way the explainer explains it there would be no doubt,Negative
Elsa,Education,I can't found the login option.ðŸ˜ ,Negative
Elsa,Education,Fantastic App and thank you for the videos but people in most countries peoole do not have the money or bandwidth to watch the videos on high quality. Please introduce a quality setting in the app untill then i will have to use Youtube to watch your videos since it has a quality setting.,Negative
Elsa,Education,everything is best BUT app crashes Everytime i try to open reading section... CANT DO ANY READING.. content is so great but opening browser or laptop for every reading after video doesn't work.. Would give it 5 star after this is FIXED,Negative
Elsa,Education,I faced glitches a lot.... After completing the course challenge loading does not happen..... ðŸ˜­ While taking any course challenge we get back if we touched the back button once unknowingly... My suggestion is that change it to twice to go back...,Negative
Elsa,Education,"For the past 3 days I'm unable to use this app. It gives an error message ""unable to use course. Check your connection and tap to try again."" My connection is perfectly fine with all other apps but this one. Please help",Negative
Elsa,Education,It won't let me sign up/create a profile but it doesn't say why. All the error message says is An unexpected error occured. Please try again later...that tells me nothing. I have tried exiting and re-entering the app and re-entering my info but it still says the same thing.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Came back to Khan Academy after a few months and somewhere along the way an update (v6.10.0) rendered this app nonfunctional. Intermittently practice questions, quizzes and reviews will freeze when checking the answer. Exiting the quiz, program, or app and restarting does not solve the problem as you'll end up stuck at a blank screen upon returning to said question. Until they fix this issue, there's really reason to use this app.",Negative
Elsa,Education,Please explain why you only get 1 chance at a question and if you fail you dont get a second or third chance.Its really stupid because some of the videos don't explain it enough and when you go do the quiz you fail the question once its done no more chances.Make it so we have at least 2 or 3 chances.Edit:I CANT GET ANYTHING RIGHT IT SAYS MAKE THE LOWEST TERM I DO AND IT SAYS WRONG AND PUTS SOME RANDOM MIDDLE TERM OR LARGE TERM NUMBER.SO CONFUSED????,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Before when I downloded this app, it was working properly. All assignments properly opened. But after the recent update, the assignment are not opening. Whenever I open, it shows that ""The content isn't loding right now"". In the PC it opens, but in phone it doesn't opens. I want you to please fill this issue.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"""Error making task progress."" Everytime I click on practice it spins for awhile and then gives me this error. I love the website so much!! I wish the app worked.",Negative
Elsa,Education,The videos are ridiculous just to get a solid grade i had to sit through him explian to move a shape over 2 spaces. They act like everyone is brain dead. Everytime ive had to do this ive wanted to destroy my phone because of how long these videos are.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Tried to do the first practice lesson,writing numbers in standard form, basic stuff. Got to question 2 of 7 and it will not allow me to to check my answer, I am literally stuck. I even tried using a hint, which counted against me, to see if it would let me check my answer then. Still nothing. Then I find out there is literally no one I can report this bug to so they can fix it and I can resume brushing up on my math. I'll just use youtube and online worksheets instead of wasting my time.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"It's very buggy and everytime I want to play a video it theres a 6 second delay between me pressing start and the video actually starting. Plus, when there are consecutive videos I would like to watch they do not automatically go to the next video which is a nuisance since I dont want to scroll all the way to the next video. Hope you guys can fix this issue",Negative
Elsa,Education,"i downloaded this app based on a recommendation but as I'm screening it for my son I'm receiving task errors on everything. Hopefully this issue is resolved soon, this is pretty disappointing.",Negative
Elsa,Education,It is the best app for study vut the biggest problem is that while taking unit test if one question gets wrong so the points will decrease in a great ammount and if there is one question wrong so there should be a resing option and after resinning we can do it again,Negative
Elsa,Education,App worked wonderfully. Now the app struggles to load exercises and freezes upon completion of tests. Very unfortunate. Khan academy is a phenomenal resource.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"The website works, but the app connected to it does not. you can't move past the sign in screen even if you have an account. It's endlessly frustrating.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Used to be great, now any time you click on a lesson but dont complete it you are unable to use the app without first deleting the data. Sufficed to say this is incredibly inconvenient.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Doesn't load. I have deleted and reinstalled the app, and even emailed the company! But no one responded and I still cannot load ANYTHING on the app. it always says there was an error with the file.",Negative
Elsa,Education,Does not have much content for programming learners. Just some HTML and CSS. Also takes me to browser in many of the courses saying that it was not supported in app. Such a Frustrating app.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Worst designed app for math I have ever used, it has in the half hour I have owned it, force logged me out 4 times, taken 15 minutes to load, be laggy as hell. It's the worst app ever",Negative

Elsa,Education,The videos and pdfs does not even load.. at first time opening the app it did meet my expectations but when I try to play a video it doesnt even load i tried different ones and pdfs but still it failed.. pls fix this..,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Excellent app, but need technical help and couldn't find where to put it. Also a 1 star will get read, I'll fix it when I can produce mixed fractions. In the mobile app you cannot write mixed fractions correctly and as a result you get failed regardless of the answer. Please address this by adding a space function or a break or something.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"App is perfect except for Bookmarks feature. Downloading lessons cause app to crash, and downloaded content isn't available online. Educational Content:5/5 App UI and UX: 5/5 Bookmarks Downloading Feature: 0/5",Negative
Elsa,Education,Terrible selection of lessons. So truncated and scattered that I thought there was a paid version. Doesn't appear to be. Apparently just a lousy half-baked app.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"If I could rate this zero stars I would. On some of the questions you could get it right, but then it will say it's wrong, then when you look at the explanation it will say the same answer. Worst app/website ever! Would not recommend.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"This use to be a great resource years go to brush up on math skills. However, the program has become so glitchy that it is almost impossible to use.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"EDIT: I have installed and uninstalled the app more than 10 times. When I downloaded the app, it wouldn't even begin to load. All I see is a white screen then I am redirected to my home screen. Please fix this, as Khan Academy has been really helpful in my studies.",Negative
Elsa,Education,It's the best app out there for SAT preparation and it's totally free. But please please please introduce dark mode.

I'll really appreciate it and thanks for everything.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"I have only just downloaded the app and it just won't open. It keeps showing ""Unfortunately Khan Academy has stopped. Send error report."" Whatever the cause of this, it needs to be fixed as the app is practically unuseful to me.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"I remember there was a class 12th section for India separately , i had to uninstall this due to some reasons but after reinstalling the app i cant find the section of 12th, which makes it a lot more difficult to search for the lessons i require. Please fix this if it is a glitch.",Negative
Elsa,Education,I don't know why I am unable to unable to download this app as I have my full data and space In. My phone,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Used this for math, and I couldn't understand why they did certain things. there's also not a lot of room for questioning to help deepen understanding.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Pls ur download is so slow, is it bcos it's free. Abeg dis is so slow and boring by the way, bcos i am still trying under 1 hour to try and download so as to use but it does not just want to download. I want to see if it will improve me in my studies as some people says it does. Maybe if it just installes, i would be more than happy to give 10 rates if possible. If think it is embarrassing then don't just show it to people, but I just ask for an improvement. If u grant my request, I will be glad",Negative
Elsa,Education,"this would be a 5 star except you can't mute the sounds and this is a huge problem when people need a ""mobile"" app to study on the go and don't want loud sounds going off in public. this is a basic feature on almost every app please change.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Wonderful app but should allow switch beetween parent and kids and, maybe, integrate better with Samsung Kids.",Negative

Elsa,Education,"App won't load practice questions after many attempts. Also doesn't support chromecast, so it has literally no additional functionality compared to just watching on YouTube.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"The app automatically logs me on as learner, unlike the website. I am the parent and I want to be able to monitor my childs activity remotely and I can't.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Team, Khan Academy. The app crashes whenever I open a video & not able to use app. If I open the video again, it again crashes and throws me out of the app to my homescreen. Kindly solve this issue. Thanks.",Negative
Elsa,Education,I have been experiencing trouble getting the videos to play ..it says internet connection problem,Negative
Elsa,Education,"I though it would be fun to learn some new things as an adult learner, but the app is very US/colonialist focused. No histories outside the US. No politics. Not even geography for crying out loud. It is very capitalism centric, and I'm just not here for that.",Negative
Elsa,Education,This app has very poor audio. It is vert annoying to study like this!! Almost half of the explanation audio is cut and almost half of the audio is mute. How can i understand things without explanation???,Negative
Elsa,Education,"When you take the final exam, in one of the answer the ""submit answer"" button bugs and it doesn't allow you to continue. What a shame",Negative
Elsa,Education,I love your website and wanted to try your app as it looks great. But why do you need access to my contacts? You don't! Why should I give you other people's information? Please remove this requirement to use the app.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"Can't log in... Database doesn't recognise credentials that were successfully used earlier on the same day... And password reset button does nothing, so never ending loop of fails.",Negative

Elsa,Education,"The application doesn't provide any option to control the video quality like if somebody wants to view all the content in 240gp, 360gp, 480gp, that they can do that however the application are not having any option such as like that, so would request to the developer of this application please look into this matter!",Negative
Elsa,Education,I'm a parent attempting to keep track of my child's progress and assignments. The only thing the app shows me the badges earned and energy points. This information is utterly useless to me. Uninstalling the app.,Negative
Elsa,Education,I don't know why it doesn't allow me to change unit or to skip lessons? I don't want the video for example because my daughter knows how to multiple but I want the exercises. It is impossible to open them. I do not know why?,Negative

Elsa,Education,I hate Khan academy with a passion they do everything half way I would never say anything good about it it is more glitchy than slither.io when it was popular and the server could not keep up I did not use the app but it can't be good when the website is so poorly designed,Negative
Elsa,Education,This is horrible they teach you one way they want you to do it but give a test. About a way they haven't explained in my my opinion you should teach the way every way it could be asked . This is why you really shouldn't do online learning. With a teacher you can ask questions and it can be explained if he/she didn't teach you that way but got a test over it.,Negative
Elsa,Education,"I don't know if something is wrong with my device, but LITERALLY NOTHING WORKS. I can't sign up or login with my previous account, I also can't do any lessons as a guest.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"No option to change the video quality, it would be great if there's a button to do that. Lowering the rating only to grab your attention.",Negative

Elsa,Education,"I cannot find the class code , If I go to the website I cannot find it and if I try looking for a teachers email to enter the class code or enter any random letters or numbers , it shows class not found. there is no use of keeping the app in my phone , I really hate it.",Negative
Elsa,Education,"Very poor, When I am going in the app again it comes back in my home screen... ðŸ˜¡ Need to improve.. Not happy with it... Thought with everybody's review that it is good but really very bad.. Khan academy please check the problems that increase at all..Not good experience. Need to improve very well. But the YouTube videos are very nice I follow it... But the app is bad.... I thought that YouTube videos are so nicee then the app will be also nice but not at all.. ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ Now I will uninstall it....",Negative

Elsa,Education,"Generated questions load, but the material vital to answer the questions does not. Practicing is therefore useless in the current version.",Negative

Elsa,Education,this needs network its better if they update this without network cause almost all students can use this app like me im still elem. at 5th grade now then when our internet slow cause we are many at the house and ofcourse need to study for upcoming school year even though its quarantine cause we need to learn something at the house not just keep playing at house and yeah thats only my opinion hope the creator of this app will see (JUST MY OPINION) and this acc. is my fathers,Negative
Elsa,Education,I have logged into the app but I cannot see my dashboard with all my subjects and progress. It is weird. Just shows me the things I care the least about - my energy points and my badges ðŸ™„ Can the development team help?,Negative

Moodle,Education,"This app has always been meh, but at least it worked until recently. One day I tried to log on for my uni and it said the site I was trying to use is no longer supported by this app. Nothing about our moodle usage had changed, everything works fine through the browser, but apparently the app no longer thinks my school gets to use it?",Negative
Moodle,Education,"Horrible app. The UI is terrible and the app always has server errors and extreme loading issues. No matter what you click on, sites won't open and neither will files. Whoever designed this app is a retard. Also everything expires within minutes? why should I have to login every damn time I open the app? Moodle claims the issue isn't on their end but multiple universities and businesses that use this app know that the connectivity issues are because of Moodle's issues.",Negative
Moodle,Education,"You can't open forum digests in-app, there are next to no notifications, links in emails only open in browser, and the idea that you're only notified of announcements at a specific time every day is just insanely stupid. Many people need to use this service for their education, so it'd better be usable",Negative
Moodle,Education,"It is good. But I would like to suggest if maybe it could be better if us, students, could download the files sent by our teachers so it would not be a hassle for us to copy paste in ms word since some of my classmates are having a hard time doing it esp that they are only using mobile phones. Plus, the document changed the file's name once it is uploaded and sometimes it is hassle renaming it.",Negative
Moodle,Education,My first impressions have been awful - for example constantly waiting for the buffering to complete - I have also spent hours trying to navigate the system which is not user friendly - I feel it is unlikely that I will be able to complete the course requirements when it isnt clear what they are and where they are - I left some feedback for other students on the course forum and it appeared in my email inbox which was very disconcerting.,Negative
Moodle,Education,"When I try to send my files, it lags and freezes the whole app. Another complaint I have is that it is hard to navigate. Tags are a bit unclear and can get confusing. It is hard to find my courses and when some have no way to enroll in, I have to redo the navigation process every time I use it.",Negative
Moodle,Education,Handling this app is not easy.there are more useless option in the subject folders. Many more bugs etc etc.even one star is also waste,Negative
Moodle,Education,"This is one of the worst apps I've had to use, I couldn't submit my quiz only because I had to use the app. It's awful, it takes forever to work. It kept refreshing and each time it happened, I would have to login again. I was never able to submit that quiz just because I had to use this app since I couldn't access a laptop during that time.",Negative
Moodle,Education,It's really bad after the update got slower then ever and takes time to connect even on a decent to good connection hope they improve it,Negative
Moodle,Education,"I don't know if this is because of the apps developer/s or the admin of our school who's responsible for our classes but the overall experience that I had, along with my classmates, is not good, at all. Most box do not tick off even if you are finished with the lesson so that affects your progress, the reply box do not appear in discussions, and it's all over the place. The navigation is okay though.",Negative
Moodle,Education,"I hate it just because it almost made me fail many assignatures of my university because of the time's limit. You should delete that function. And also it's really hard to find the documents and whatever you wanna submmit; to add, sometimes the platform doesn't work well and when it's about taking tests it doesn't appear where to begin them.",Negative
Moodle,Education,"Im not sure why i kept notified about ""Your authentication token is invalid or has expired. You will have to reconnect to the site."" Meanwhile, i already tried for several time. I hope the apps developer able to comment on this review. Thanks and have a nice day.",Negative
Moodle,Education,"My organization shows QR code, but your app doesn't accept it. The scan QR code should have dynamic camera controls. This app takes 5 minutes to recognise a QR code, just to say that the organization doesn't support it. And then even the username password system doesn't work! Please review the issue ASAP.",Negative
Moodle,Education,"Great App , Even our 2 Hour is gone due to the technical issue and the attendance login method. Even the users with login id and password was also not able to login. Works as an old veraion app. Need many improvements as Google Classroom. Need good quality service. My Emotion is on the top abut this app. Sincerly , Need many improvements.",Negative

Moodle,Education,"Poorly built app. Basic design, search and filters don't work. Not possible to see only active courses",Negative
Moodle,Education,"When I open moodle through a computer, it's fine cause my lessons are updated but when I open moodle through my phone or through this app, it doesn't update at all! The posts lessons are from day before yesterday and I downloaded this app for a sole purpose, I don't have to use a computer (cause I don't own one, I just borrow) however if this app was made to be convenient for students that only used their phone, they didn't meet that purpose! This app is a design on your phone to look smart!",Negative
Moodle,Education,"Not recommended this app, no notification for the subject and sometimes even you reload multiple times nothing change. I don't have choice because our school using this app, but this is a bad app.",Negative
Moodle,Education,"This app takes a lot of time to open. It sometimes takes half an hour to just open a particular link, no kidding. Feels like I should go and access their web page rather than wasting my time on this app. Its slow and medieval in nature, definitely needs a lot of improvement.",Negative
Moodle,Education,Push notifications not coming in my mobile ðŸ˜  i did every possible case but notifications not coming. Please fix this issue.,Negative
Moodle,Education,"Stupid app. I tried to login not once but many times. I checked my username and password, they're correct. I even changed it so i might be able to login. Gosh, please fix this problem. You're not even helping student like this. Now i have to use other option to login and do my online exam.",Negative
Moodle,Education,"This is such a bad app. If I am not required to download it I would just unistall it. I always have problems with my classes, I can't get in or my classes were removed. The graphics looks bad, reading the lessons here looks so boring. I hope our University get some senses and just use another app",Negative
Moodle,Education,Not working for https connections. Pls rectify the problem. Earlier it was working with site .,Negative
Moodle,Education,Even after inputing correct password it shows invalid login. Moreover when you try to reset password even after providing correct email address don't received any mail. I tried logging with every possible way atleast 300 times before. Please reset my password so that I can see the scheduled meeting and join it,Negative
Moodle,Education,"Please optimize the speed and fix those bug, Stop adding new feature for time being and focus on optimization. I can accept the app is pretty slow. BUT, the very core problematic is i have a good dang connection but the app is always Failed to synchronize and tell me to check my internet connection.",Negative
Moodle,Education,"I'm having a constant error where it asks me to log in with Office 365, and before I get a chance to finish my log in, it refreshes and asks me to log in again. This happens constantly and won't let me use the app for more than a few seconds without popping up.",Negative
Moodle,Education,"Wow... I'm disappointed... I can hardly express this feeling but, quite frankly, this app is so hopeless sometimes that I just feel... drained. Like it's slowly but surely siphoning my life away with every task that I finish, every essay I send. I'm scared to use it at this point. Not sure if that, in particular, is the app's fault but it doesn't really support my experience with it in any way. Moodle just gets me into... that kind of mood. And now it made me do this terrible pun. Shame on you.",Negative
Moodle,Education,"App very lagging, so-so display. It takes forever to download one single file as small as 10 kb, at first I thought the problem lies on my wifi, but other apps just run normally. In conclusion, this app sucks. Might change my mind if you add to-do lists, and make the app way faster.",Negative
Moodle,Education,This app is horrible. It won't let me log on and gives error although all the information provided is correct. I even got the IT team at my university to help it and they said the app is messed up. I'm so frustrated. Do yourself a favor and don't download it but use the website if your school requires you to use moodle.,Negative
Moodle,Education,Horrendously horrible!! My university which is 100% remote utilizes Moodle and yet this app states that my college is not a participant. That does not make any sense to me. Wish I could give no stars or even a 1/4 of a star but alas I must give at least one. Do not waste the time it takes to download and type in your info. Save your precious minutes.,Negative
Moodle,Education,"Every time I close the app, it asks for log in again.",Negative

Uninstalling this waste of my time.",Negative
Moodle,Education,"This app was made by useless donkeys. Crushes every time im taking a test or trying to submit an assignment.

Moodle,Education,"My clg is using this app nd I'm totally fed up of it, it's not at all user friendly. Doesn't function well nd gives us lot of tension as a student when, at times, it shows certain courses can't be accessed, then sometimes when u upload an assignment u hv to keep recheking like min 3 times in an hour, coz there r chances fr the app to just consider it as invalid.

Moodle,Education,I noticed what the app and the computer together or that the app is very slow to load in it requires you to be on very strong internet connection and I noticed with loading in with the app sometimes when you think you have something on there it will not be on there it requires me to refresh about four times and I don't know what's going on with the application so this is why I recommend you not get this app,Negative
Moodle,Education,Not able to provide all system contain over official uni website.... Sometimes you are unable to upload files.... Also takes too much time to load... If any university student using this so it must be faster as we have to solve quizez and upload assignments in short given time.... But it just cause downgrading....,Negative
Moodle,Education,"Worst Ever App. What is the use of an app that uses a QR code when you are just on your phone. Why not just login with email & password ?? Website needs to be alot more simpler too. Have to click on too many things to get to one thing. Also the grades for completed Semester aren't there, like did I pass or not ?? Grades need to stay up all the time, we are paying for this so why not listen to us. Subjects should be up the week before starting, so we can see videos & get familiar with it.",Negative
Moodle,Education,"Always something is not working!!! No matter what I do, it never show me only the courses I'm doing at the relevant semester. Instead it's showing me all the courses I did in the past and I in to search them.",Negative

This is a new bug that seems to have started after the last app update in April 2021.",Negative

Oxford,Education,"I wish I could give less than a star for this. It's so annoying. I tried to download the database for offline mode. Wasted my mobile data after several download restarts only for it to complete and still ask me to download database in my next launch. I did that again and it was even more waste of time and data... Still no offline mode. Like why does a dictionary database even have to be that large in the first place, there should be a version without audio and unnecessary additions.",Negative
Oxford,Education,"I recommend not to download it, because there are other better dictionaries that give you more free features, like allowing you to hear pronunciation of the word you're looking for and its examples as well in the free version, and other free features too",Negative
Oxford,Education,"Utterly disappointing tosh. Most searches end up with an advert that you can't get rid of, so you end up having to shut down the app and re-open it before starting again. There is much advertising of the upgraded version. I'd save yourself some time and frustration by simply using an online dictionary if you don't have a paper one to hand.",Negative
Oxford,Education,This app if full of ads you see ads every 5 seconds until you buy the premium version which costs a lot. Hated it dont waste time downloading it . Poor interface,Negative
Oxford,Education,The free version is almost impossible to use without undergoing a nervous breakdown. Uninstalled it after half an hour.,Negative
Oxford,Education,"Annoying app. Uninstalled within 5 minutes of use. I understand you need to use ads for the free version, but at least let me use the app before you start bombarding me with ads.",Negative
Oxford,Education,"Although the print version of this dictionary is quite good, the app is another story. Basically, the company is overly greedy. Not only is the app filled with intrusive advertising, the ads are created to be as annoying and obstructionist as possible to manipulate users into shelling out money for the paid version. I honestly would not mind paying for a quality dictionary app, but then they expect you to pay an additional $15 annually? It's exorbitant and outrageous. You certainly wouldn't have such an unreasonable stipulation for the print version of the dictionary!",Negative
Oxford,Education,There are too many ads also offline version is asking to subscribe.The worst part is it is asking to watch videos to unlock the every word searched.So what is use of this dictionary.At least you may have shown words without ads.,Negative
Oxford,Education,"The app is installed today, found it the meanest of the mean, stingy, it doesn't even allow you to search a second word. A pop-up screen saying today's quota is reached, forcing you to join their premium version by paying a subscription. Come on, not yet.. the worst trial experiences of an app in the 2020s. Considering that they bothered to make an app version, a one star â­ is given, but decide not to use it. There are many user friendly apps out there I'm sure, like, Merriam-Webster...",Negative
Oxford,Education,Waste of money. Contains annoying advertisements. Recent updates made it user hostile. Simple hoaxing to squeeze money. I am uninstalling it. I am writing this about paid version of the application.,Negative
Oxford,Education,"Their most recent update made the free version unusable. You can only look up one word a day, unless you pay $10/year. They changed their set up so that they could make more money off of users, but hopefully they'll realize soon they're only lossing money this way and go back to ads. If that happens I'll come back and they'll make money off me again. But really, like everyone else who uses this dictionary I have it out of convenience, I can just Google a word and look it up that way instead.",Negative
Oxford,Education,"Unless you are buying this app dont bother. The free version is useless.

Oxford,Education,"This is an appalling app. Currently doesn't work at all, giving me a ""you have used up all your free searches today"" message on the very first search leaving me unable to search for even a single word. In response to this response. Do not list this app as 'free' then. It has no free tier and is in no way a free app. In fact the free version is a spam app as it's only functionality is to serve ads.",Negative
Oxford,Education,"prompted to buy premium app during every search...every. single. search. No thank you. *UPDATE*: Since my review, the developer responded with a statement which basically said ""Yep, we do that, LOL."" Several reviews show the same frustration, and the developers respond unapologetically that, yep, that's how it is, and that's how it's gonna stay. I get the ads are necessary, but the in-your-face straight up pimping of the premium version during every search is not.",Negative
Oxford,Education,"This app was my favourite dictionary app, but not now! The developers have screwed it up, by slowing it down so much, in the hope we will purchase the premium version? But its not worth the money!!! My advice is NOT TO UPDATE to the new version, the old version was much better!",Negative
Oxford,Education,"Uninstalled after recent update allowing only one lookup per day unless you pay for the premium version, at a ridiculous rate and requiring an annual subscription. Stupid business decision - before this change you at least got ad revenue from me. Now you don't get a penny. This app was great for our Scrabble games. Using another dictionary app now.",Negative
Oxford,Education,You have to pay to access a lot of words. As a student without money to spend it's just better for me to use the completely free online version.,Negative
Oxford,Education,When I first tried this app I liked it so much that Within a day of downloading it I purchased the full version. I was able to use it completely explore the app and see the features of it with only the usual type of ads being displayed in the free version. MOBI has changed its policy to one free word per day it gives you no opportunity to really explore the app or see what it's like. To me this is predatory marketing and shows the attitude that the company has adopted No longer recommended,Negative
Oxford,Education,Totally Garbage & Waste of Time. Earlier it was working good. But after the recent update it is not working at all. it just reflect searching but result are shown. For Offline version it ask 159/- one time payment. When ONLINE version is not working then obviously OFFLINE will also not be working. I am UNINSTALLING it with a disappointed heart. If anyone know any good dictionary app please do reply to this comment.,Negative
Oxford,Education,"I am a paid subscriber of app ""etomonline"" etymology dictionary of the Eng language. I wanted to check the OED app (although I have a CD version of the OED), but the app sucks, honestly. For two days now, I get the message, that I used my one free word/day, although I didn't use my one free word/day. The definition of worthless. I could get a free 3 day trial, but why should I do that for anything that sucks that bad? Seriously. Better $90/yr on the OED website, say I.",Negative
Oxford,Education,"I have already paid for the Premium version of the app, but with the latest update, there is a new Premium membership which totally superseded the previous payment that I did. Now I have to watch adds to use the features which I already had paid for. Edit: I know how to restore the license that I bought, is just that with this licensing service, every single day that I open my daily word, I receive a reminder to pay for the new premium service, more spam for the things that were already working fine. I bet you didn't took this use case in consideration during your tests.",Negative
Oxford,Education,"Glad I've got the printed version. Pay for the app if it gets rid of the ads. Screens are simply SO busy with ads I couldn't even see how to look up the words. It's a dictionary, some things should stay in print.",Negative
Oxford,Education,"I bought the premium version, yet it's off line mode could not work. Turned out its a known issue, if you browse on line or just in the reviews under this app, you will find the same complaint times and again. And every time their tech support would give you the same answer: it's not our problem it bcuz you use storage cleaner apps. Yet mine does'nt have one. If I were their coder of Mobi system I'd not be proud. Save your dollars for other apps.",Negative
Oxford,Education,"One free word a day is practically useless. Why even bother having a free version, if that is how limited it is. Just make it cost money in the first place so that people don't waste their time downloading it unless they want to pay for it. Also, that's what ads are for. Plenty of apps are free due to advertising...",Negative
Oxford,Education,"Checked one word and upon the second the quota was up; the purchase of a premium version was being called for. Britain really has fallen from the old glory, even the promotion of English as a culture is too extravagant. Oxford Dictionary with such an old name can not afford to survive.",Negative
Oxford,Education,"This app is a nuisance unless you get the paid version. It interrupts you constantly, prompting to buy the paid version and you can't listen to the audio clip of word pronunciations with the free version. If you don't want to pay then there's no reason to use this instead of googling a word.",Negative
Oxford,Education,Demanding the premium version subscription as soon as I installed the. App.,Negative
Oxford,Education,I purchased the pro version. But need to download offline content daily. Nearly 300mb daily download to use the app offline. Horrible. Never experienced such in other paid applications???????????? Already downloaded offline content 4 times. But daily I'm getting the info regarding fresh download,Negative
Oxford,Education,"I do not recommend the app! That's completely ridiculous! You really give just one free definition per day? If you want everyone to go to premium, then update the app to a pre-paid version. I'll never install this app once again.",Negative
Oxford,Education,"Why is it necessary to access to Photos and gallery? And so many adds. Allow me to use the dictionary without providing access to the photos, i will be happy to update my rating to better one, and I'll be happy to use the compromised version, if any, in case i don't give photos access.",Negative
Oxford,Education,DON'T BOTHER! You get a limited number of words per day - which is absolute trash. If you dont like that then you have to pay a monthly fee. At this point just buy a book version as it'll be cheaper in the long term. AWFUL APP,Negative
Oxford,Education,After paying for the full version last year it's now unavailable. The payment has been replaced with a subscription and it's wiped out my purchase. Horrible way to do business...,Negative
Oxford,Education,"Horribly overpriced, even the free version! Have to watch a 20-30 second video for EACH word lookup. The paid version is $19.99 /year... expensive & you don't even own it, you just RENT it each year! I removed app after using it just 5 times!",Negative
Oxford,Education,Does not work in offline mode despite having paid version and downloaded offline content. Every time i try to switch to offline mode it asks to download files and even though files are downloaded next time again it will download files. Only works when connected to internet. Waste of money,Negative
Oxford,Education,Free version has so many full-screen ads that it's useless. Some of these are high-bandwidth video ads WITH SOUND. This is outrageous. Deleted.,Negative
Oxford,Education,"Completely unusable. The ads are atrocious and make the user experience abhorrent. The free version is so bad, there is no way I would be willing to pay for the paid version to get rid of the ads.",Negative
Oxford,Education,I uninstalled this app as it is useless without a subscription. The free version only gives access to one word a day. This should not be marketed as free at all. I'd be willing to pay a one-time fee but I cannot understand how the cost of subscription is justified.,Negative
Oxford,Education,"Ads with sound? No thanks. Uninstalling. I understand that the free version relies on ads and I don't mind seeing them when they have text, pictures or videos. But sound is too intrusive.",Negative
Oxford,Education,Waste of time! When you tap on the word you just looked up it doesn't let you see the definition unless you buy the premium version of the app. You literally can do nothing without purchasing the app. Isn't it beautiful?,Negative
Oxford,Education,"Just installed this App, on entering first word itself, it is telling to go for PREMIUM option, so decided uninstal. My suggestion, why the App developer to put in free category instead better to put in paid version. Hope Android team will regulate such...",Negative
Oxford,Education,"Waste app... Though I purchased premium version of this app, It shows regularly to download offline contents for offline use, I have downloaded it for more than 20 times , Still it shows notification to download offline contents after two three days use of offline dictionary. How many times should I download offline version ?",Negative
Oxford,Education,I download the app and try to look up a word. I get hit with a pop up saying I've used up all my free word searches (this is the first time I've ever used this app) and that I need to purchase the premium version. Steer clear of this trash.,Negative
Oxford,Education,SO many common words NOT defined. A pathetic version of the of-so-reliable printed version. Free but not worth 1 cent! Also SO annoying that every time you open this app it asks for a FIVE (!) Star rating. What hubris!,Negative
Oxford,Education,"Purchased premium and downloaded offline dictionary. But everytime i am reopening app, again i have to download offline dictionary again. Full bug with offline. Pls rethink before purchasing full version. Wastage of money for premium.",Negative
Oxford,Education,Misleading. Hence pathetic. Once you try input with the mic the app prompts you to buy advanced version. It's not a big deal. 10 swiss francs per year. But the approach sucks. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,Negative
Oxford,Education,"Intrusive ads and severe limitations for non-paying users, the paid version may be good but if you don't want to pay for the app, don't try it. Tip : Linguee dictionary",Negative
Oxford,Education,"In order to get access to definition of one, I repeat ONE word you have to watch 30 seconds of an ad. Current state of free version is unusable.",Negative
Oxford,Education,Not free as word limit per day. Now subscription based as company want to con people. I can buy an Oxford dictionary for Â£10 each year. This company want you to pay monthly instead of a one off fee for a version of the app. Why not release 2020 version then next year updated version 2022 and so on.,Negative
Oxford,Education,I paid through INR 79 to avail paid version but it was not accessible by me... please solve it...I raised a issue again i shared with my payment details with their support team but no solution taken by them but they denied.Ithink it is a fake to show premium content....very pathetic.I already given my bank statement for balance deduction with proof but they denied.Stop fooling people from other continent....,Negative
Oxford,Education,"Hey atleast include any feature in offline or in unpaid form. Ads are there no problem, we adjust with that because of unpaid version but you have to give minimum options.",Negative
Oxford,Education,I paid for this app and when tried to reinstall it on my tablet it would ask for annual subscription for premium version. No more payments!!!!!!!!! You won't se a dime from me anymore.,Negative
Oxford,Education,"Even after downloading the offline database, after sometime I'm again asked to download the database again. Because of this I'm forced to use online mode even after paying for pro version.",Negative
Oxford,Education,It doesn't work at all. Doesn't give the meaning even after 1 minutes of searching. I don't know what's the problem. Maybe only the paid version works properly,Negative
Oxford,Education,"Very poor experience. Refuses to load simple definition queries passed via e readers, and trying any option like offline definitions just pushes for paid version. The opposite of useful or easy.",Negative
Oxford,Education,"The level of adverts in the free version makes it unusable, and it will be a cold day in hell when I spend Â£20 on a dictionary app.",Negative
Oxford,Education,I purchased my premium version but couldnt download the databases. It starts downloading but after some time it stops.I tried all the ways by clearing the app data and tried downloading nd changed my network and wifi but no use of it. I m frustrated.Pls give me a solution for thiz as soon as possible.,Negative
Oxford,Education,"Yesterday, after updating to the latest, I tried to re-install an older version of the app via package manager (APK file) because I didn't like the latest one, but then I was unable to install/open any Oxford dictionaries/apps via APK files, and was able to install them via Google Play only. This is happening only with Oxford dictionaries/apps and not with any other apps. Why? Please fix this ASAP. It's very frustrating. Why am I unable to install Oxford dictionaries/apps via APK files anymore?",Negative
Oxford,Education,A dictionary app with a monthly subscription that does basically what any free search engine does? A free version where you have to watch an ad for one word meaning? Your ratings are going to go down so quickly!,Negative
Oxford,Education,"Great for a day or two. Since paying for the full version I now have a widget that I can do nothing with. Sure, I get a notification for the word of the day but that's not much use if you can't search the dictionary. How do I get a refund?",Negative
Oxford,Education,"'Free' version only works online and is jammed with ads. Considering number downloaded, price is far too high. Big disappointment.",Negative
Oxford,Education,This app is paywalled. I'm sure the pay version is nice but this free version is not useful. Don't waste your time. Either buy the real app or look elsewhere.,Negative
Oxford,Education,Never seen a app like this before. Shows a add every time you search a word. Also the premium version is not upto the worth .,Negative
Oxford,Education,I downloaded the app. Searched for ONE word in it. And it told me I used up all my free words for that day and asked me to buy a full version. I didn't use any words yet... It lies to you that it's free. Edit. I did not click on anything before searching for the word that interested me.,Negative
Oxford,Education,"Not worth the time. The app doesn't pronounce the words unless it is the paid version ... And in addition to that, it is flooded with unwanted ads.",Negative
Oxford,Education,"No pronunciation available in free version & leads to annoying pop-ups to pay for Premium version. Too many adds, just a waste of time. Uninstalling it straight away.",Negative
Oxford,Education,"Not have a lot of phrasel verbs on mobile version, but I can find on a desktop version. You need to correct this problem. I paid and I no have what I need. I need my money back.",Negative
Oxford,Education,Wow you can only look up 1 definition per day in the free version? How do you use a dictionary properly that way?! Why even make it free to begin with if you're going to do this? Insane,Negative
Oxford,Education,Shows too much ads and can't even use audio feature without buying the worthless premium version. There are much more better apps. Please don't download this one,Negative
Oxford,Education,Cant use in offline mode . Every day asking 288mb download. Feels irritating (its my full purchase version) even one star is more than high what tjis app deserve . I dont have any cleaner app inspite of that every day asking the same,Negative
Oxford,Education,I paid for the premium version and you would expect the translator to be part of the bundle but alas your greed gets the better of you. There are actually better value for money dictionary apps out there. Look elsewhere,Negative
Oxford,Education,Downloaded free version and paid for premium. Nothing changed. Still can't have access to offline dictionary. Want my money back,Negative
Oxford,Education,"This is a Useless app, Full of Ads, free version is very limited and The subscription cost is 700+ Rupees, Also the UI experience was bad too, Uninstalling .....",Negative
Oxford,Education,"Disappointing experience, even when I paid for premium version & downloaded offline dictionary I cannot use offline mode & every time I try to use the offline mode the app keeps showing that I have to download the offline version. Please help.",Negative
Oxford,Education,"I have the pro version but still I'm not able to use offline mode, when I enable offline mode it downloades the database and after a day or two it again asks me to download the database.... My money is wasted bcz of this",Negative
Oxford,Education,I think I don't want to give any card info till after the trial period it is possible I don't want the address version so you can't use my information ahead of f time to create confusion and put my card out there,Negative
Oxford,Education,Yep I think this is a good idea for me an my son so he will be able to check out the new version of how important it is for him to be read and understand each n every word.,Negative
Oxford,Education,"this is a useless app, it doesn't work offline as advertised. But instead they required one to purchase an offline version for about $10. Don't waste your time downloading this app.",Negative
Oxford,Education,i can't use offline reading for free version. try to give trial version for offline reading to know the feedback from us as a user.,Negative
Oxford,Education,I think this app is completely useless on offline mode. No word can be seen..... Right now I am using the free version.,Negative
Oxford,Education,Nothing works without payment. Other dictionaries at least deliver audio pronunciation in free version but have ads.,Negative
Oxford,Education,"Free version seems useless, don't want to have to watch a video to get a simple definition. Very disappointed.",Negative
Oxford,Education,you can not use the free version as a dictionary. Actually it's a machine to show adds for paying 12.99$.,Negative
Oxford,Education,OED was my first choice from last three year but from the paid version are come I'm going to uninstall this app there are lots of free dictionary app.,Negative
Oxford,Education,"why you place ad over the non premium version ,kind of annoying .if i have an internet connection i prefer google search not for this one .",Negative
Oxford,Education,Wrost app. You can only see one word per day which is suggesting. To see unlimited word searching unlimited premium version required,Negative
Oxford,Education,"So full of ads, push to buy paid for version and pop up request for 5 star rating that it is of little value.",Negative
Oxford,Education,No offline mode for free version,Negative
Oxford,Education,"Can now only favourite one word per day, this is after me building 100s of favourite words. Paid version is way too expensive for such a simple app that a Dev like me could build in a couple of days",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"Slow to open, bulky even with offline mode turned off and extremely pushy with it's subscription. Way better and simpler dictionaries are available. It's ad heavy and most features are turned off without paying for them. Very unimpressed.",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"I don't appreciate the suscription concept. I do not need other features than offline word lookup and navigation. I need a dictionary like a physical book that you buy once and that's it. When I bought it several ago it was like that and I will use it as long as I can, then I will find something else(or start to carry a dictionary with me). Shame on you, milking people for nothing. The dictionary itself is good, but this review is mostly about your new way of making money.",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"I recommend not to download it, because there are other better dictionaries that give you more free features, like allowing you to hear pronunciation of the word you're looking for and its examples as well in the free version, and other free features too",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,Locking basic features behind a paid monthly subscription is scummy. I'm not spending any money on your app,Negative
Dictionary ,Education,Was able to browse and view words definition but after last update you can't view any word defintion without paying premium or watch ad videos (1 word per ad). Before it had some locked features for premium. But when the app main purpose is locked. What's the point downloading it then? Download other dictionary apps.,Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"Please do make the offline feature non-premium. Searching words are being held back because of this feature. Showing that if we want to view this word, we've to subscribe premium. If you make this offline features available at non premium, it will be very helpful.",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"I don't recommend to purchase this app. The only plus is the amount of words in the dictionary and good I'll call it ""word search"" just by clicking on them in the definition. But in overall this app is just too expensive. There is an audio pronunciation that is terrible. It sounds like talking with someone who drives into tunnel. There is also no thesaurus for this price. You can find this two features in other dictionaries that cost the same.",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"I'll use Google to search for meanings. I know that Oxford is the best dictionary everðŸ“– , but its 'one word limit' is really bad and frustrating. I request you to change that feature. Let this app be the best rated app on Play Store. But, the limit is the only reason this app is not getting enough attention.... I'll use Google until you remove the limit.",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"Charges to look up more than one word a day. It's word of the day feature gives words that are insultingly common. I'm baffled by how this app has garnered 50 million downloads. There are much better dictionaries available on play store that have good words of the day, and don't try to charge. Edited to respond to developer: English isn't French. Authority on the language can be revoked by consensus and this seems like an efficient way to accomplish that in a devastated post-pandemic economy.",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"Its a trash app. It lacks key features easily available on google search's dictionary. And most importantly, the damn widget doesn't work. I put it on my home screen and its just sitting there blank, showing nothing. You have to start the app in order for the widget to work. And the widget does not work when I switch off my phone and turn it on again. I must start the app in order to make the widget work every time I turn on my phone. Its such rubbish. Text to speech is a premium feature. Trash.",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"The policy of making a paid-for app free, but then altering it to having a premium/monthly subscription model, stinks! It's disgusting. OED used to stand for something good; but it obviously don't no more! Incidentally, the word of the day feature IS useful; but M-W's is hands-down better. Thanks for your reply, but it did nothing to pacify me (an apparently once-premium user).",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,When I first tried this app I liked it so much that Within a day of downloading it I purchased the full version. I was able to use it completely explore the app and see the features of it with only the usual type of ads being displayed in the free version. MOBI has changed its policy to one free word per day it gives you no opportunity to really explore the app or see what it's like. To me this is predatory marketing and shows the attitude that the company has adopted No longer recommended,Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"I have already paid for the Premium version of the app, but with the latest update, there is a new Premium membership which totally superseded the previous payment that I did. Now I have to watch adds to use the features which I already had paid for. Edit: I know how to restore the license that I bought, is just that with this licensing service, every single day that I open my daily word, I receive a reminder to pay for the new premium service, more spam for the things that were already working fine. I bet you didn't took this use case in consideration during your tests.",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"I downloaded this app for it's word of the day feature, and it has been an utter disappointment in that regard. The selections are often overly simplistic, and occasionally the WotD is just someone's name. And damn, are there a lot of ads in this app. Very not good.",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"Pop up(copy) feature rarely works. There should be a guessing game of your bookmark words, any game that helps you remember your bookmarked words.If you uninstall this app you will lose all your bookmarked words. No syncing of bookmark words across devices android to android or android to iOS .",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"At Playstore, it is mentioned that it is free. But, most of the features is locked/paid which are generally available for free in most of the app. It would be fair if the App developer let the user know that only one very general feature is available for free and rest are paid.",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"Downloaded, searched word, prompted to watch video or pay. Seriously? You think making basic dictionary queries deserves a pay/ad wall? I mean premium features sure. If I wanted to make a mind map or have flashcards or whatever, but uninstalled as soon as I couldn't get a basic dictionary definition without paying with ad time or cash",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"As a developer I understand it's important to make money but nearly every thing is paid feature, offline = pay, Audio=pay, etc. More annoying clicking accidentally bring that annoying pay to unlock bottom sheet. You'd better off searching that word online than using this.",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"A rather very irriating thing happens when l try to turn on the offline mode or when l tap the mic button,it asks me to upgrade to premium so as to enjoy such features.Does it mean that we have to pay money just for looking up words?l don't get it!",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,This application is a problem when it comes to payment. Today morning it showed meva discount of 50Rs for paid features and net I had to pay around 70Rs I transferred from my debit card using Google Pay and it ended up debiting Rs 436.84 instead of Rs70. I really don't know how to get my balance money back.,Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"Hey atleast include any feature in offline or in unpaid form. Ads are there no problem, we adjust with that because of unpaid version but you have to give minimum options.",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,No single feature of the app is available offline. At least the recent words and viewed words should be displayed offline.,Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"You get to look up one definition a day before asking for paid membership. This is a new ""feature "" you might say.",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,Shows too much ads and can't even use audio feature without buying the worthless premium version. There are much more better apps. Please don't download this one,Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"Every time I use the ""copy"" feature on my phone, and I mean anywhere on my phone, this app pops up, takes whatever I've just copied and pastes it into its own search box as if I want to search the dictionary for that. Come on, please!??? Really???",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,"Earlier I could look unlimited words for free and other features required premium, now it allows only one word per day.",Negative
Dictionary ,Education,Just downloaded after sometimes although below ratings are bad.Asking me to buy the premium from the beginning.Haha can someone use your features without paying that much for you. I think there are better dictionaries than yours. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž,Negative
Dictionary ,Education,full of ads. Many apps providing more features without advt.,Negative

Wikipedia,Education,"I truly love the wikipedia app, but suddenly the crowned feature, the Places tab, is missing from my version. This feature placed nearby articles on an interactive map. It helped me navigate new cities, and turned the world into a museum. I loved it. It's necessary. I can't for the life of me figure out why it'd be removed. A light has been lost in my life, hence the dim star rating. With it, it'd be 5 stars. Without it, only suffering.",Negative
Wikipedia,Education,"The app was incredible at one point, but now it has some SERIOUS navigational issues that have rendered it basically broken. The back button no longer works properly, as it immediately takes you back to the featured article rather than the previous page. Getting to the actual home screen of the app is much more difficult than getting to the featured article. Articles will open over previous tabs, rather than opening a new tab. Portals are also essentially broken within the app. Please fix these!",Negative
Wikipedia,Education,Latest update not so good. Today's featured article keeps defaulting on top of the home page. Is there any way to suppress this as it is frustrating. Also the floating continue reading bar at the foot the screen is intrusive and takes up space especially on smaller screen. The sliding bar on the right often gets in the way and swiped menu takes up most of the screen width when opened,Negative
Wikipedia,Education,"Removed Primary Feature. I used to love this app, I used it to discover nearby points of interest and to learn more about local history. This feature worked by overlaying Wikipedia information onto a map which you could interact with. When I looked up support and found related article it says that they removed this feature due to privacy concerns people had. Doesn't it make more sense to either toggle the feature based on allowed app privileges or even hosting a parallel app with this feature",Negative

I've been unable to use the app on my son's Acer Chromebook Tab 10, and up until the update that was his primary way of working on his math assignments. We've switch over to the website for now, but it is not nearly as easy to use with a touch interface. Please fix! Other than that, this has been a wonderful app to see grow over the years. I've used Khan Academy with both my children for several years now and they are both excelling in math. Sal Khan is a legend in our house.",Negative
Khanacademy,Education,I find the current available content of this app and its website extremely invaluable in my search for learning supports for both myself and my children. I am having some technical difficulty using certain aspects (ie moving points) due to the incompatibility with my tablet. It would be useful if I were able to remain logged in simultaneously with my kids' profiles with the option to switch between them.,Negative

duolingo,Education,"I'm currently on a 50+ day streak using Duolingo. I updated today, and it moved me to a new heart based system. Now, if I make enough mistakes, I run out of hearts and am no longer able to learn. The app holds your ability to learn a language hostage as punishment for making mistakes WHEN LEARNING. The desktop version doesn't have these hearts, so I am able to learn from my mistakes and at my own pace. The desktop version works in a mobile browser. This app hinders learning. Go to the website.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Using to learn French for 543 days now, paid nearly $90 just to never see ads(for one year), and not have hearts. Which, if you're trying to use this without paying that good luck. Honestly it's sad, the stuff they've been adding recently is just not good at all. I couldn't care about a ""mistakes tab"" or having to sit through 3 second clips after the end of a lesson. I'm just trying to get in, learn and get out. The only good update was when they added darkmode, no settings to turn off trash.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"I would've given 5 stars until now, but the recent updates suck. I hate the new ""heart"" mechanic, especially considering that the new content has buggy questions without correct answers. Changing the story mode to be dependent on crowns makes sense, but I'm not sure that I like it. Overall the app is still good, but the updates should probably be more polished before release.",Negative
duolingo,Education,I do not recommend this for people wanting to learn a new language. Not only do you have to get every single word right (which is impossible with some words) but it's also boring. I dread doing my lessons to progress because this app made me lose the drive to learn a new language Update: It's worse now. They tried making it more fun but all it is is absolutely infuriating.,Negative
duolingo,Education,"Used to be a great app, and I was happy to tolerate the repeated advertising. The updates since Easter now limit free learning to five errors per session with enforced breaks of hours unless you subscribe. The entire process to this point was based on putting in the time and completing lessons. Now they end half way through if you make too many errors and no further access without paying. Unless you want to pay Â£60/yr or only plan to spend v few minutes per day, pick another free language app.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Issues frequent. 1) fixing problems in courses can take years; 2) updates can erase your daily progress; 3) the speaking characters take a lot of my screen, make the app slow, and can't be turned off; 4) animations after finishing a lesson are slow and can't be skipped or turned off; 5) app kept crashing at final lessons of a course, making it impossible to progress.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"This app has hit an all time low, I was getting on well, then suddenly ""ran out of lives"" now pay lingots or go plus to carry on learning! You earn 1 star for this update, put the app back to how it originally was, I cannot learn being forced to pay money, or get it right first time, with a wait time of 5 hours for 'One' heart/live seriously! #1 top grossing! Very disappointed! Pay for me to learn, or update the 'Lives' system!",Negative
duolingo,Education,I used to love this app and use it daily. There was a new update I assume that made it unusable on my phone. I cannot swap between languages nor can I tap on any lesson. I am just there staring at the main screen and can only go look at the store/leaderboard. The UX copy for the streak freeze description is also very poor work. I have no clue what 1/2 equipped does versus 2/2. Please test your new features before releasing.,Negative
duolingo,Education,"This app used to be great, now you have lives and when you're out you need to refill or wait. Sometimes it takes 2 lives for a mistake. Than you have an add that says that they are trying to make the learning free and fun but with every update they are trying to make users pay for the premium version by putting limits on how much you can play. This leads this app to be barely playable and impossible to enjoy. Lastly, in Greek course they messed up the lessons so all of the progress made is gone",Negative
duolingo,Education,The app was working well until a recent update and now I am not able to select lessons from the menu. Having managed to get up to a streak of around 235 days it's slightly disappointing that this won't be preserved and that I can't access lessons daily as I used to. Would have been a positive review initially but the app is now basically unusable. I have reported the bug but was advised I wouldn't receive a response and I can't see this being readily fixed. Using a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra.,Negative
duolingo,Education,"Duolingo was wonderful, but after the last update it is horrible. They changed the font to a much smaller san serif which makes it quite difficult for me to see. I also liked to know how many points I was earning for the day. They deleted that feature and replaced it with dancing animation. I'm not sure, but I will probably delete Duolingo and try Babble.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Good app but the grammar and vocab rules and advice they give is really minimal. Also, it seems fundamentally flawed that you are tested on words before they tell what they are. LESSON 1 of teaching : tell people the word or rule BEFORE you question them. Utterly demoralising if you don't and you will LOSE ALL RESPECT for the app!! Wake up DUO! Update May 2021: Utterly stupid to use the word ""percents""",Negative
duolingo,Education,"I was competing with someone for the 1st place in the diamond League for the badge and in the last minute, I passed the person and got the 1st position and kept watching the time finish the last few seconds where I was still in 1st position and when it updated after the time ran out, the app told me I finished in 2nd place. That's wrong. I am sure I finished in 1st position and still did not get the badge. Just want to make me give up of this.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"What a useless update, linglots were more easy to understand rather than this gem system and as a result now i get less gems if converted to linglots. One more thing, earlier getting podium position in the leaderboard gave linglits as rewards but now after topping the charts doesn't give rewards. Really really bad Duo..",Negative
duolingo,Education,Since the latest update the app has become progressively more unusable. At first I was unable to do the '+1 heart practice' and Now I can't even start a regular lesson! This is incredibly frustrating as I have a 118 day streak which I'm likely to lose as I can't use the app any more. Please provide a fix asap!,Negative

Please improve this on your new update ASAP. It will HELP us lot.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Since last update, can't access lessons unless I have purchased a streak freeze. This bug is most likely due to the pop up asking if I want to purchase one. Makes the main portion of the app literally unusable.",Negative

duolingo,Education,I truly hate the hearts system how is anyone able to learn if the mistakes they make count against them and they have to wait a day to be able to try again or pay 7 bucks a month. If this isn't fixed with the next update I'm uninstalling because this is ridiculous.,Negative

duolingo,Education,"Since the most recent update, this app is in full screen mode, hiding the nav bar, by default. It's really annoying me. Please stop it or allow the option to stop it.",Negative
duolingo,Education,Used to be a brilliant app. The hearts system is terrible and means you can't finish the harder lessons without paying for it. Big mistake that will result in many lost users if not corrected. Update: I was hoping to get used to the hearts system but it just punishes you for making mistakes. I learn by making mistakes over and over. This system means I have to wait a day to practice the new content again or change focus onto other content to regain hearts.,Negative
duolingo,Education,"Just restarted using this app, loved it before and had contemplated paying for the ""pro"" subscription. But with the update, they give you a limited number of ""wrong answers."" If you deplete this limit and don't purchase more, the lesson automatically terminates making you start over. This is a user pain point. I used to recommend this app to everyone looking to start a new language, mostly because the app was fun and seemed to pride itself in helping people learn over making a PROFIT. No more.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"I've been using this app for over a year (433 day streak), but it seems like every new update makes it harder to learn, not easier.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Everytime something new is implemented it's effectively useless or negativly impacts the user experience. After losing a ton of progress with a major update, distracting little characters were added with speech bubbles that don't match the narrator, as if this is catered to 5 year olds. Now the app will give you a chance to 'double' your XP on an exercise by taking a more difficult lesson. What it failed to say was there is no streak bonus, so if you do well, it actually does not double the XP.",Negative
duolingo,Education,makes learning impossible. everything has been updated to make it completely unusable to learn unless you have duolinguo plus. every simple mistake is penalized. it prides itself on being a replacement for school classes but I don't ever remember a school lesson kicking me out for missing too many answers to tell me I need to pay money to get the premium experience. I used to love this app and it made me excited to study Spanish. now I dread it in case I miss too many questions. this app sucks.,Negative
duolingo,Education,"I used to love this app but the new blue gems and the heart system are horrible. The gems used to mean something but now the amount you earn is disproportionate to the amount you have to spend so they are worthless. And the hearts mean you are getting penalized instead of learning from mistakes. It's just not fun or useful anymore. Update: No change, the system just feels like a Money-grab now. I actually actively recommend people not to get it, you will not learn unless you pay. Don't bother.",Negative
duolingo,Education,The updated version stinks! It was a good app before that. Now it constantly glitches and freezes on every other phrase on all the devices I've tried learning on. It also keeps kicking me out of lessons making it impossible for keeping my score up. As something I use to look forward to use on the daily I'm deeply upset that this update is prohibiting me from learning.,Negative
duolingo,Education,"Been using this app for a year now learning Russian. I love the course. I have my issues with the way duolingo teaches, but if you make an effort is an amazing tool. All that said, the new hearts system they have introduced is a real kick in the balls. It's absolutely terrible and makes the app basically useless unless you pay. If you haven't yet chosen a language app, PICK ANOTHER. Unless they get rid of the hearts system DO NOT USE THIS APP. Update: they still haven't fixed it. Unusable.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"I use to love this app so much, could spend all day learning languages. Now with the new heart system I am punished for getting incorrect answers. Learning languages thrives on repetition and having to wait hours for the hearts to build back up is useless. Fingers crossed this update is reversed!",Negative
duolingo,Education,"With all due respect, could you fix your damn servers already? Connection issues appear on a daily basis. Every other app on my phone works fine. Problems happen only in Duolingo. Update: it's been almost a week and the problem is still there. Judging by other reviews, thousands of other people experience the same problem. You've built a company that's worth billions but still can't solve basic issues. Right. You're probably just too busy pushing people to buy premium accounts. Great work.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"I used to love this app but the latest update has made it almost impossible to use without paying. Yes, I agree that software developers need to be paid for their work, but with the amount of advertising we're bombarded with between lessons and 100M+ installs I don't believe any payment is warranted. I use the app to study 11 languages, ranging in level from absolute beginner to almost expert, but my frustration since the last update has me on the verge of uninstalling it. Please remove the idiotic ""innovation"" of only allowing 5 mistakes per day (for someone who only has time to use the app in the evening the fact that the hearts slowly build up again over a period of hours is useless) and give your enormous user base reason to continue using this app Update April 2021: Not only do they continue to use the stupid points system, but the software is now full of bugs. I got a perfect score on the final checkpoint for the French course, only to see the points I gained disappear, even though the system says I finished the checkpoint. Most days I have to cut my studying short because I run out hearts - it's no use trying to push myself, as the extra effort is penalised instead of rewarded. Message to the geniuses responsible for this idiocy if you were minimally intelligent you would understand that by getting people to complete more lessons they would also be watching more adverts. I guess some concepts are too hard for you to grasp...",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Duolingo used to be my go to for learning a language but the new update is terrible. The lives take away the purpose of self paced learning, the stories are a good addition, but the content in the lessons is terrible. It is very repetitive of useless phrases. There is not enough focus on grammar or spelling and many of the questions are multiple choice meaning you don't actually learn anything. The voices are computer generated and it doesn't pick up on pronunciation. Btw I am learning french.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Duolingo used to be my go to free way of learning, however since re-downloading and losing hearts thereby losing progress for making mistakes, I've been completely thrown off and am gonna find an alternative. It's sad see duolingo go from their original tagline of ""wanting to make learning fun and free"" to ""throw money at us or you won't go far"". Terrible update, yall basically ruined the whole point of the app ðŸ¥º",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Loading screen for Duolingo used to say that their aim is to make language learning free and easy, or words to that effect. The new update has totally gone against that.

Hope they see these reviews and revert back",Negative
duolingo,Education,"It was great at first with potential, but each update is getting worse. Not tablet friendly. Updates are buggy. Heart system impedes learning.

duolingo,Education,"Decent app, have used it for years. The latest update however punishes users for mistakes, taking away ""lives"" until you pay with gems (once you run out, then you have to pay real money) or join their premium service, which you pay for with real money.

duolingo,Education,"So far easy to use. You choose your own pace, you can get away with 15 mins a day for when you don't have a lot of time the lessons aren't long. When you have more time you can knock out a whole section. What I really love is that the lessons aren't overly repetitive. UPDATE: On March 20, 2021 I was charged 89 dollars on my credit card for a sub I DO NOT WANT!! NOR SIGNED UP FOR, Ive sent emails w no response I want my money back please!! UPDATE#2!! Thank you so much Katelynn! Prob slvd",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Terrible. Upgraded to ""Plus"" and lost all my progress, had to start over from the beginning. I've tried to contact support and heard nothing. Won't be continuing with the app if this can't be restored. What a terrible experience. 0/10 would not recommend. Will update review if I get ant response from support.",Negative
duolingo,Education,All updates have been garbage. The Japanese update was more hiragana & katakana. Seriously?! After all that hype about revamping it?? The heart system has significantly brought down my active time. I only use it to keep my streak and still miss days. And the new characters' faces look so disgusted and angry when an answer is wrong! Can we please have Duo back at least? At least as an option?,Negative
duolingo,Education,"I already gave the app 2 stars in my last review and it just gets worse. There is too much latency since the last update; some of the selections don't work and I get incorrect answers. Also, the answers that are close to the original essence/context of the sentence/phrase is considered incorrect that I had to fact check with native speakers to actually check if I was really wrong. And the bots within the app are not being addressed at all.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"One of the worst apps it's has been very glitchy since the last update the characters don't move,it marks my correct answers wrong tbh If you have an Android version 6 and lower don't download this stupid app. And to fix this glitchiness I cleared out every bit of storage for this to work but it just doesn't work. I'll just stick with lingodeer.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Upd: The app keeps switching to offline even though there are no connection issues. The update didn't help. _ Hey Duo, here's the thing. As much as I enjoy your lessons, the loud and obnoxious ads is the one and only reason why I'll never pay for Plus. I'm not supporting your devs who don't mind blasting full-volume ads at the unsuspecting non-paying users who just finished a lesson with listening exercises. It'd be great if you could drop them a hint that perhaps it's not such a good idea.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"I'm sad that it was updated so that now you can only mess up five times before having to spend your lingots on more hearts to continue to learn that language. Or you have to pay for the full app to have unlimited hearts. This was the one cool language app and everyone knew that, but they ruined that and I'm so disappointed.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"This app was ok before, but never updated in a meaningful way. Then they tried to ""gamify"" it too much and now it's just garbage. My favorite part is how you can now pay 200 gems to try to skip a level, but are only awarded 6 gems if you pass (/s). I already feel bad enough competing with people who have more time and knock me down every week. On top of this the thirsty ads and incessant popups for Duo+ are gross. One star though for improving Japanese with the new Hiragana/Katakana tab tho.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"This app is indeed a useful one. However, a matter of regret that the app didn't include all spoken language in the world. Like, I am a Bengali speaker. 'What language do you speak ' didn't mention about Bengali language. Being a Bengali speaker, I couldn't use the app properly. So it would be better if the app is updated. Waiting for the response. Thank you",Negative
duolingo,Education,"One star specifically because of the idiotic heart system. It actively inhibits learning by punishing mistakes, and is a obvious attempt to push people towards the paid app. Until the latest update, I was on the version of the app without hearts, and had been using it for years. Now, I am leaning towards uninstalling and finding another way to learn languages. Update: the number and irritating nature of ads has also increased.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"I know that language is a difficult thing for a computer but this app rejects plenty of valid answers. It also fails to specify things like singular or plural in areas where it isn't clear in English (eg ""you""). This makes it confusing for knowing the correct translation. This is a pretty irritating app. Apart from the annoying interface, things like updates take ages. I have a good Internet connection (via wifi) and the current update has been running for 3 hours now and is up to 32%.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"I'm rating a 1 based on the newest update for the free version. The heart system is terrible. I do my daily lessons with my son, who is more likely to make a mistake for us due to accidently pressing an incorrect button. Being kicked out of a lesson and losing progress is so much more frustrating and does not motivate me to keep going. Challenging a difficult lesson will no longer be enjoyable. Update: it also no longer holds progress if you switch between apps. All lesson progress lost. Awful",Negative
duolingo,Education,"They have totally destroyed the experience in this app. As a teacher myself and having used this app for more than a year, the latest updates deter from the fun learning experience offered before. Now you run out of hearts which makes it a harrowing experience and one that is time consuming and demotivating. You can practice to gain hearts but not the skill you keep failing on. Great if you are just getting started but prepare to have your progress staggered and delayed.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"This app was supposed to be about free education, but it became corrupted with a recent update. Now the app punishes you for your mistakes and makes it more difficult to keep a streak and keep practicing daily. Buying premium supposedly helps you support free education, but at that point its not free anymore. This was supposed to be and app for education, not a game. People learn by making mistakes, I just hope duolingo learns from theirs.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Before duolingo was updated, there was no hearts. It was more free. I make a mistake and learn. When they added hearts, I would fail most of my lessons and won't have enough money to buy new hearts. Its better to learn duolingo online where there is not hearts and you won't fear making a mistake in a lesson and you can finish a lot more lessons. My dad finishes 25 lessons a day when he does it online. I finish around 10. When I do it on the app, my father does like 5 lesson, and I would do 2.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Going from the best to possiblity worst language learning app with just one update. Not only there is more advertisment than the content, but there is this horrible ""hearts"" system. You have 5 hearts, and a mistake costs you a heart. Mistakes tolerance has gone down from previous version. And on top of that the hint gives you the WRONG answer. Solution? Buy premium. Blatant cashgrab. Duolingo was never good enough to learn a language, but was at least a good addition. Now it's just horrible.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Learning French. Recently (end Feb 2021 after update) I ran in to problems with a lot of audio examples being quiet. It happens when playing an audio sample and having four ""spelling examples"" to choose from, also one or more of the four possible answers are silent. When playback of full sentences etc it works fine.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"New update cant do the speaking excersise any more. Always struck a little and then ""that doesnt sound right"" ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“",Negative
duolingo,Education,"It REALLY REALLY upsets me that if the exercises in a course are updated you lose all of your crowns and progress for those! I've been exercising 200+ days on German and I have to redo the basics to get to levels 1, 2, 3... again and again... The update warning does not tell you about this really big issue! UPDATE: Recently introduced ""in app"" notifications about the achievements of people I follow. They are annoying and there is no way to disable them. The only option is to unfollow people.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Needs work, audio all over the place, unintelligible at times. Too many americanisms, cookies? candies? No. Biscuits and sweets/sweeties!! Update, notification settings need improvement. Update, audio still as variable, still plagued by americanisms - unable to realise the world learns English as a universal language.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Since their recent update I find myself hating Duolingo! You're not able to make mistakes, you lose ""hearts"" and are bullied into purchasing more before you can continue your lessons. After not doing any lessons you have to start over in the file! The speaking lessons are hard to hear, I feel they do this on purpose so you'll mess up, then comes their instrusive ""premium"" ads; one actually interupted my lesson! Who are you guys trying to impress? App is junk, and not even worth it; uninstal!",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Loved this app at first. Was fun to learn and seemed to be working. Then in the last update it switched from failing an entire lesson lost a life, to each mistake does. When learning a new skill lesson locks you out for several hours if you miss 5 in 25. So 80% is failure lockout. Just a way to try to annoy users unto paying for premium. The last update also caused the keyboard to block what you are typing so you cannot proof read your answers. It also is 450 to refil mid lesson vs 350 in store.",Negative
duolingo,Education,I really like the app. I really do. But I HATE how my friend on IOS has SO MANY more functions on her app then me!! We're learning together and it sucks that she gets extra experience from leaderboard boosts and has legendary levels when I don't even have the listening tab!! I understand trialing new features but this is too much of a difference. Please update android to match the IOS app. This is just too much.,Negative
duolingo,Education,I am really confused. I searched up what the words are called in Spanish and English but I did not get the right one. When I searched it up (for example the word name) I got nombre but in Duolingo nombre was not an option. Can someone fix it or is Duolingo just teaching us nonsence.( Now after a few months after I wrote all that) I have updated Duolingo and I saw that the checkpoints were becoming SHORTER and the stories too. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS I LOVED TO LEARN,Negative
duolingo,Education,"Rating was 5 stars until I updated. The heart system completely ruins the learning experience. You cannot learn efficiently while only being able to make 5 mistakes a day. Duolingo has completely undermined the function of its app, entirely in the name of greed. The ad supported version allowed Duolingo to become a hundred million dollar company, they don't need to punish language learners like this to keep growing.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Used virtually every day for a year and a half. Has had issues with male voice and occasional errors but solid. And was a useful tool to learn. 1 star Because, the update with the heart system is just pathetic. Comes off as a shameless cash grab on par with candy crush. Totally disgusting. Its now basically impossible to learn from mistakes. And beyond that, really cant stand the new element of terrible characters showing up mid lesson, obnoxious and just ugly. Really lowers the quality.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"An update deleted all of my progress after a 150 day streak, and I even paid for a yearly premium subscription! Do NOT download this app, there are better language learning apps that actually explain grammar or conjugation and won't make you figure out the rules of the language by yourself. I was halfway done with the Greek course and an update deleted 2/3 of my progress, and there's no customer support to call, email, or talk to! The email I sent was met with ""don't expect a personal reply""...",Negative
duolingo,Education,"I used this app for a bit trying to learn German and fot busy and wasn't able to continue until recently I went to pick it back up again and the new updates that added hearts make it impossible to get back in to it, the whole appeal of the app from lessons that were paid for by adds in between and constant practice but the three hours to restore one heart just makes me not even consider paying for your scheme of a subscription",Negative
duolingo,Education,Just got the update for this app and you for some reason have gone back to this weird energy bar where you make mistakes you cannot progress. What you had before worked so why change it? I gave you 5 stars originally so now I am considering uninstalling it. My kids used it to learn Dutch and Spanish,Negative
duolingo,Education,"Duolingo used to be amazing, but it has gotten worse every update. Now the constant bombardment of ads and new heart system make it basically unusable. They've strayed from their mission of making language learning easy and it's a shame.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Went from being one of my favorite 5 star apps, to not functioning at all on my LGV60 (2020, fully updated phone)... it just sits black screen, flickering and locks my phone up until I force quit the app. Please fix!! I hate using the website on my phone.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"I used to love this app until the last update introduced the heart system where you can only make one mistake every 4 hours, making mistakes is part of the learning process and if the app throw me out everytime I am out of hearts and I make a mistake then it's useless.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"After using the app everyday for almost a year, I opened it to find all my past completed lessons gone! Updates clear all your user and learning history. The moderators are rude and unhelpful. If the language you want to learn is available on another platform, use it over duolingo.",Negative
duolingo,Education,The only app Ive ever used where the updates and changes are flawless and fun. Extremely well made.*update* and then they changed it to where you can't even do two lessons in a row and hearts take forever to regenerate so now I don't use it at all cause it's useless. UGH! Seriously you lost a fan Duo!,Negative
duolingo,Education,"My favorite part of duolingo was doing the stories. As a result, I made it really far into all of the Spanish stories. After a recent update, now, I can't do anymore stories until I obtain 400 crowns in the lesson section! Very disappointed",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Pedantic to the point of supidity, especially when incorrect translations are used for the answers...often stupid Americanisms. Used to be good and well done regularly updated. Now lazily churned out rubbish by greedy profiteering scum that appear to have taken over. Would not pay for premium again after 2 year's it's declined massively in quality",Negative
duolingo,Education,"This was a GREAT way to learn languages, but I recently got the update with the hearts system and after only a few lessons, I decided to uninstall. The app is ruined. It was good while it lasted.",Negative
duolingo,Education,Does not explain anything. 5 mistakes and your out. This updated version with 5 hearts is terrible. Way to expensive to by a year membership. Used to like it very much but now its horrible. Much better less expensive apps out there.,Negative
duolingo,Education,"I am very dissatisfied and unmotivated with the latest updates from Duolingo, since I finished last week in third place in the ranking and this week in first place and I did not receive any score as it happened before. Please kindly correct this bug.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"11/20/20: Fun app, hopefully it will prove to be beneficial in learning a language, or at least give a fine foundation. Update 3/22/21: Can't open app anymore. The last update screwed something up.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"The app is more focused on being game like than teaching language lessons. Lately I've had terrible input lag in the lesson that makes it slow and frustrating to use, ever sense the update that added cartoon characters to the lessons.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"edit: new update is riddled with bugs. Such as, though I complete my daily goal, I lose my streak freeze. Frustrating when I have to spend gems every time Duo decides that I didn't log in and complete my dailies. Lost a 173 day steak this way... Done.",Negative
duolingo,Education,I love this app because it helps you to learn but after the update with earning hearts and waiting 4 hours not a good strategy to PUSH people to buy premium. Mistakea are one way to learn but waiting will kill the enthusiasm to learn. So disappointed.,Negative
duolingo,Education,"I am taking French lessons since this January. Everything was fine till last update. Since the new update I am facing problem in ""Read and Respond"" section. The ""Next"" button no more appears and thus am unable to proceed with my lessons. Please fix this problem.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"After a few months of use, language packs are failing to update or install. Even after uninstallation and reinstall. Looks like I may Uninstaller and cancel the subscription. Phone used:S20 Ultra.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Loved this app but hate the introduction of the heart system, where after 5 mistakes you're banned from playing anymore unless you pay money. Very disappointing update as I used to love using this app.",Negative
duolingo,Education,NOBODY LIKES THE NEW UPDATE Removed the random test button which added variety rather than focusing only on one topic. The heart system is the worst idea ever! Who came up with this idea needs to be fired! Mistakes are common due to autocorrect and typos but now you get punished for this! Before you could learn all day without restriction now you have to pay if you lose your hearts. Disgusting and greedy pay to win mechanics do not belong on a learning app! Uninstall if not changed,Negative
duolingo,Education,"I have made an account, updated the app, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and it still doesn't let me access anything other than the account page and the leaderboard page. The shop and first page do not work. It is literally useless",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Edit 2021.03: the latest app update made it impossible to update the offline course. So, in summary, you have to be online to access the offline feature, the progress doesn't synch properly, it doesn't update properly.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"It works slowly and it takes me 10 mins to run. And cannot go back and check again and work. And tips are not that much useful, at least for me. Wish to see better changes and updates.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Hangs forever, even after deleting and reinstalling Update: no change whatsoever. I can follow a push notification and get one lesson, then it hangs again.",Negative
duolingo,Education,After the last update it will no longer open. It shows white loading dots and never opens. I deleted and redownloaded it and still can't open it. I'm going to loose my 30-day streak because of this.,Negative
duolingo,Education,"Android/LG just pushed out a system update, and now duolingo won't open. I have sent email to the developers and posted on a duolingo Twitter thread requesting help. I have paid for a year and am only two months in. I want my money back!",Negative
duolingo,Education,"terrible updates, the last six months the application has been working with errors, slowly, does not want to load pages, everything has become bad",Negative
duolingo,Education,The new update sucks. The loading screen is appearing in the middle of the lessons again and again. and the worst part is that I can't even exit it.,Negative
duolingo,Education,Most recent ATT Android update seems to have broken the app. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but after login screen it doesn't go anywhere.,Negative
duolingo,Education,I wanted to learn English But when the apps asked me to chose my native language I couldn't Find it I think you should add tagalog-Filipino Language in this app My fellow Filipino wanna learn English too And I wanted to recommend this app To help them improve their Grammar I hope in the next update there would be tagalog-Filipino Language,Negative
duolingo,Education,"After latest update the app crashes continuously, can't use it. Sloppy and inacurate translations, confusing grammar errors continue to be a disadvantage.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"After the login I only have the lower menu available, the rest is dark, and can only Access the achievements page the rest does nothing.. Empty canvas even after the update",Negative
duolingo,Education,After an update app is not usable. I can login but can't see any course. I really liked the app too.,Negative
duolingo,Education,I really love this app but for the past 4 days it crashes any time I try to open it. Even after i downloaded the update,Negative
duolingo,Education,New update has a lot of bugs I am unable to buy anything in the shop if I do something on website it does not updates on the app,Negative
duolingo,Education,Let's start with NO i would not recommend it at first I thought it was grate then after some time I realised it was not at all sutied my life style or humans life style the amount of notifications I got was unbelievable and extremely unnecessary it was not helpful that when I used it meaning when I went on to it and I had Full Hearts if I got something wrong well I would lose heart and by the time I lost all my heart's it would not let we keep going I feel that they could try and update it,Negative
duolingo,Education,"The Irish Gaelic needs a hardcore update. In comparison to Spanish and other languages on the app....its poorly developed. There are no hover features to help you pronounce all the words in Gaelic... so, you're kind of in the dark on trying to speak it. You'll learn how to read phrases...but not how to speak them or listen for them. PLEASE update your Gaeilge. Its the main reason I downloaded you. ðŸ¦Š",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Latest updates erased all my course progress. Reported the problem, haven't heard anything back. Really disappointed because this used to be a decent app. EDIT: Still never heard back from my email inquiry. FAQs now say this is because of them trying to match up with language learning standards, but there's no option to test out to get progress back. They need to balance new levels with not making their users feel like all the time they put into the app was wasted. Really bad UX experience.",Negative
duolingo,Education,Was not able sign in with my Google account on any of my Android phones. I always get a white screen and nothing ever shows up. I was really looking forward to learn German. Used the app previously to learn some words in Russian which really helped me. Please fix the issues and I will update my review. Issues occuring in android 7.0 and 8,Negative
duolingo,Education,"This app has hit an all time low, I was getting on well, then suddenly ""ran out of lives"" now pay lingots or go plus to carry on learning! You earn 1 star for this update, put the app back to how it originally was, I cannot learn being forced to pay money, or get it right first time, with a wait time of 5 hours for 'One' heart/live seriously! #1 top grossing! Very disappointed! Pay for me to learn, or update the 'Lives' system!",Negative
duolingo,Education,"I'm currently on a 50+ day streak using Duolingo. I updated today, and it moved me to a new heart based system. Now, if I make enough mistakes, I run out of hearts and am no longer able to learn. The app holds your ability to learn a language hostage as punishment for making mistakes WHEN LEARNING. The desktop version doesn't have these hearts, so I am able to learn from my mistakes and at my own pace. The desktop version works in a mobile browser. This app hinders learning. Go to the website.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Used to be a great app, and I was happy to tolerate the repeated advertising. The updates since Easter now limit free learning to five errors per session with enforced breaks of hours unless you subscribe. The entire process to this point was based on putting in the time and completing lessons. Now they end half way through if you make too many errors and no further access without paying. Unless you want to pay Â£60/yr or only plan to spend v few minutes per day, pick another free language app.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Something has gone horribly wrong since the last update with the overweight lady and gay athlete jumping with joy together with Duo after completing each lesson. ðŸ˜  It is no fun waiting ages for the app to open or even load anything between lessons. Please give us back the speedy, streamlined app that was Duo before these stupid evil jumpers slowed everything down and earn your 5 stars back! 2nd edit: I've reverted to using the web based Duolingo. Finishing 2 lessons by the time the app starts!",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Good app but the grammar and vocab rules and advice they give is really minimal. Also, it seems fundamentally flawed that you are tested on words before they tell what they are. LESSON 1 of teaching : tell people the word or rule BEFORE you question them. Utterly demoralising if you don't and you will LOSE ALL RESPECT for the app!! Wake up DUO! Update May 2021: Utterly stupid to use the word ""percents""",Negative
duolingo,Education,"This new update loses my place on a lesson if I navigate away. I answered a text message and I had to start the lesson over from scratch. This happened multiple times with incoming calls, texts, messenger, twitter, etc.",Negative

duolingo,Education,"UPDATE:ONE STAR bc the now the only concern is getting our money. Is a gimmick now Update: The only thing I don't like is that I can master a certain ""circle"", and the next time I log on, its telling me I'm ""weak"" in certain words! Or a once yellow circle, is red, green, or blue...and I don't even KNOW what the different colors signify.... But the rule should be if a certain level is mastered...its mastered! Perhaps give a refresher every once and again, but at the students discretion!",Negative
duolingo,Education,UPDATE: AFTER A STREAK OF 452 DAYS I HAVE NOW UNINSTALLED THIS APP. Duo says: it's not about perfection but progress. Except now you have to get it perfect or you lose a heart. Why lose a heart for a simple typo? I spend 10 minutes going through a lesson but run out of hearts before the last question. I haven't completed a whole lesson in nearly 3 weeks so not making progress. Get rid of the hearts Duo - it looks as if you are just in it to make more money.,Negative
duolingo,Education,It has a bug in latest update 4/27/2021 and I can't get help,Negative
duolingo,Education,"What a useless update, linglots were more easy to understand rather than this gem system and as a result now i get less gems if converted to linglots.

That's wrong. I am sure I finished in 1st position and still did not get the badge. Just want to make me give up of this.",Negative
duolingo,Education,No reason for the android version to never be updated like the iPhone version. Feels like I'm stuck in the past.,Negative
duolingo,Education,Because there have no choice to my country. update quickly to select all country just like Bangladesh.,Negative
duolingo,Education,Good app but the update is terrible. Stop trying to make the app for preschoolers. It is mostly teens and adults who use this regularly.,Negative
duolingo,Education,"New update cant do the speaking excersise any more. Always struck a little and then ""that doesnt sound right"" ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“",Negative
duolingo,Education,"My app updated and now I have lives and gems. I am okay with gems, but limited amount of lives and unlimited only on plus is a bad thing. I hate it so much. How is this still learning if I am punished for mistakes. That is not right on many levels.",Negative
duolingo,Education,I truly hate the hearts system how is anyone able to learn if the mistakes they make count against them and they have to wait a day to be able to try again or pay 7 bucks a month. If this isn't fixed with the next update I'm uninstalling because this is ridiculous.,Negative
duolingo,Education,"Before the hearts update, when I was struggling with a new topic I could practice until I understood it. Now I'm limited to five mistakes before I have to use gems to refill my hearts, or go back and pointlessly practice things I already understand. Tbh I usually go back to the basics lesson and do a hard practice just to earn my daily goal and then shut the app, my motivation gone because I'm irritated. It slows down my learning. Also keep getting talking exercises when I have them turned off.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"This app used to be great, now you have lives and when you're out you need to refill or wait. Sometimes it takes 2 lives for a mistake. Than you have an add that says that they are trying to make the learning free and fun but with every update they are trying to make users pay for the premium version by putting limits on how much you can play. This leads this app to be barely playable and impossible to enjoy. Lastly, in Greek course they messed up the lessons so all of the progress made is gone",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Ever since the new update and the elimination of weekend streak freezes, the game forces me to buy a streak freeze in order to play. If I decline, nothing works. Guess it's time to uninstall and move on.",Negative

Please improve this on your new update ASAP. It will HELP us lot.",Negative
duolingo,Education,I do not recommend this for people wanting to learn a new language. Not only do you have to get every single word right (which is impossible with some words) but it's also boring. I dread doing my lessons to progress because this app made me lose the drive to learn a new language Update: It's worse now. They tried making it more fun but all it is is absolutely infuriating.,Negative
duolingo,Education,"Duolingo was wonderful, but after the last update it is horrible. They changed the font to a much smaller san serif which makes it quite difficult for me to see. I also liked to know how many points I was earning for the day. They deleted that feature and replaced it with dancing animation. I'm not sure, but I will probably delete Duolingo and try Babble.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"New updates make this app a lot more annoying. The clear attempts at the typical strategies of annoying the user into spending money immediately make me want to uninstall. Further, some of the new ""characters"" they've added are just annoying, and distract from any potential learning. The app used to be good.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"While I love the overall concept of Duolingo, the app becomes more and more unusable. Ads are way too intusive and the plug for Plus is way too long and appears after every lesson. Additionally the app is very slow to implement features of the website. I study Dutch and there are still no Tips in the app while they are on the website. I will switch to a web version for the time being. Update: Additional engaring feature - thumbs up to random people for achievments. I do not care for it one bit!",Negative
duolingo,Education,"I've been using this app for over a year (433 day streak), but it seems like every new update makes it harder to learn, not easier.",Negative
duolingo,Education,The app was working well until a recent update and now I am not able to select lessons from the menu. Having managed to get up to a streak of around 235 days it's slightly disappointing that this won't be preserved and that I can't access lessons daily as I used to. Would have been a positive review initially but the app is now basically unusable. I have reported the bug but was advised I wouldn't receive a response and I can't see this being readily fixed. Using a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra.,Negative
duolingo,Education,"I would've given 5 stars until now, but the recent updates suck. I hate the new ""heart"" mechanic, especially considering that the new content has buggy questions without correct answers. Changing the story mode to be dependent on crowns makes sense, but I'm not sure that I like it. Overall the app is still good, but the updates should probably be more polished before release.",Negative
duolingo,Education,Having real issues with latest update. Will not respond to clicking on lesson icons!!!!!!!!! How basic a fail is that. Contacted app author with no response three days later.,Negative
duolingo,Education,"Issues frequent. 1) fixing problems in courses can take years; 2) updates can erase your daily progress; 3) the speaking characters take a lot of my screen, make the app slow, and can't be turned off; 4) animations after finishing a lesson are slow and can't be skipped or turned off; 5) app kept crashing at final lessons of a course, making it impossible to progress.",Negative
duolingo,Education,The new update is really the worst,Negative
duolingo,Education,Since the latest update the app has become progressively more unusable. At first I was unable to do the '+1 heart practice' and Now I can't even start a regular lesson! This is incredibly frustrating as I have a 118 day streak which I'm likely to lose as I can't use the app any more. Please provide a fix asap!,Negative
duolingo,Education,Don't update!!!! The new update is bullsh..... to get your money!!!! I wish I had not updated..... :(,Negative
duolingo,Education,"The new update's animation is kinda annoying. What a waste of time. It makes me want to uninstall immediately. If only my phone does not update apps automatically. I also prefer the old comment section format, the new one is not pleasant for the eye.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"[***] The app was updated two days ago, and since then it doesn't start lessons... [*] Edit: it happened because I didn't buy the second Streak Freeze... On top of the cartoonish UI they have these childish rules...",Negative
duolingo,Education,It was a very good app until the newest update came. U cant move onto the next lesson without hearts and if you make mistakes the hearts decrease. If u want more hearts u gotta pay money....I thought this was a FREE learning app..... Please remove these updates and bring back the original version. So disappointing â€”_____â€”,Negative
duolingo,Education,Was great but is going downhill. The heart system is a great way to screw poor people out of an education and the recent update has a lot of malfunctions including not being able to open and start lessons or switch languages,Negative
duolingo,Education,I used to love this app and use it daily. There was a new update I assume that made it unusable on my phone. I cannot swap between languages nor can I tap on any lesson. I am just there staring at the main screen and can only go look at the store/leaderboard. The UX copy for the streak freeze description is also very poor work. I have no clue what 1/2 equipped does versus 2/2. Please test your new features before releasing.,Negative
duolingo,Education,"Since last update, can't access lessons unless I have purchased a streak freeze. This bug is most likely due to the pop up asking if I want to purchase one. Makes the main portion of the app literally unusable.",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Using to learn French for 543 days now, paid nearly $90 just to never see ads(for one year), and not have hearts. Which, if you're trying to use this without paying that good luck. Honestly it's sad, the stuff they've been adding recently is just not good at all. I couldn't care about a ""mistakes tab"" or having to sit through 3 second clips after the end of a lesson. I'm just trying to get in, learn and get out. The only good update was when they added darkmode, no settings to turn off trash.",Negative
duolingo,Education,Not liking the new update there really pushing you to pay for pluse. Also they need to have there speaker speak clearly I don't know how many times I hear them say una and estas and it turns out to be un and este it like they want you to run out of turns and buy pluse. If there a good alternative to Duolingo I like to know.,Negative
duolingo,Education,Updated yesterday and now it freezes when I'm three questions into a lesson. Some of my lingits dissappeared as well,Negative
duolingo,Education,"Since newest update, I can't select any lessons. Tapping doesn't work and the only time I get to practice is when the notification dor practice comes through. Please fix",Negative
duolingo,Education,"With the recent update, even with Plus status, I can't even access any of my courses. I can see them, but can't click on them. Any other tab I can see and interact with, except my courses! What's the point of this if I can't do what this app is made for?",Negative
duolingo,Education,"Since the most recent update, this app is in full screen mode, hiding the nav bar, by default. It's really annoying me. Please stop it or allow the option to stop it.",Negative
duolingo,Education,Since the last update I haven't been able to switch languages or do anything on the app it's totally broken for me now,Negative
duolingo,Education,"In a recent update I can't exercise, I can't start any lesson. Why? I have full hearts.",Negative

photomath,Education,This is not for those students who are pursuing graduation in Bsc maths . If u really want to get good reviews and spread knowledge so do update it.,Negative
photomath,Education,"Horrible app. Has a lot of bugs. DONT DOWNLOAD. Now that I have your attention, the app before the update, was actually quite great. It helped me with numerous math hw, and it also explains how to solve it. After the update however, the camera on Photomath wont focus on the part Im scanning. I scan it directly on what I want to be solved, and the part it scans ends up tilted for some reason. So now its basically unusable. I hope it gets fixed soon.",Negative
photomath,Education,"Everything was good from the old it explains everything, every steps and why's.....now from the new update it needs 7 day trials! What is this a joke!? It's hard to understand every explenation now since there's this new update!",Negative
photomath,Education,there is a bug even though I have updated yet facing same problem. problem is that when I select the equation in the camera and as I press the capture button this captures another side of the page WHICH I am not asking second it shows the image horizontally but as I press the capture button it goes to vertical image.,Negative
photomath,Education,I used to use this app.. The update changed everything..... You have to pay if you want to understand everything.... No offense but its really bad ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­... I hope you changed it please,Negative
photomath,Education,This app used to be my favorite app because it showed expainatoins from diferent people so it made sence but then it updated and now it doesnt even help with questoins.A year ago i would tell everyone to get this app right awaybut now i just do not rec geting this app.,Negative
photomath,Education,It gives me wrong answers i always get wrong in maths photo math does not help me it is useless it is always not working it is just nonsense i hate this app u guys should update it for you,Negative
photomath,Education,It doesnt help when you need help i have to go to other math apps to meaning if you have an equation the app is always saying we are not able to do this right now we will update.,Negative
photomath,Education,Useless app this take lots of lotsof time before giving the right answer please fix this problem. But thanks cuz some of my question got its answer please next time make a new update,Negative
photomath,Education,Used to love this app but now with the update i have to pay to see all of the steps.,Negative
photomath,Education,Because of the new update it needs to pay before finding the deep solutions... I want old version back,Negative
photomath,Education,Useless cannot solve simple algebra i wish they could update system,Negative
photomath,Education,"Please remove the premium thing, students or teachers are here for the formulas not that premium things, we need the FULL formula;and also update the camera it blurs alot",Negative
photomath,Education,"The update messed up everything. I've been using photo math for years now. Not only did I use it for getting homework answers to my assignments, but also it's useful in teaching me the procedure for doing a math problem. It was today when I tapped the ""explain"" button and the whole new ""Photomath Plus"" offer showed up. At first thought this was an app project to help students, not do business with them. But now that's changed. Uninstalling since it no longer serves my needs to explain problems.",Negative
photomath,Education,"This app was amazing until the new updates require you pay to see the detailed steps. As a college student, this was a great resource for helping with my math homework when I didn't have access to a tutor. But now I am unable to to see the extra steps to help me with my math problems because I have to pay for it. I cannot afford to pay for the ""new"" features as I already have student loans to pay for. :(",Negative
photomath,Education,It was perfect until the latest update. Why did you have to destroy it? The Android version was beyond better than the iOS but for an unknown reason you though that redesigning it would be better. Photomath is an app that doesn't need the latest graphics and animations but a friendly environment that is not confusing you. My head hurts! Trying to figure out the app again!!ðŸ¤¯ðŸ˜–,Negative
photomath,Education,"For me, the new update just ruined everything. The last version was better in a way that I can freely slide from camer to calculator to history and such but now I need to press it to change it. Also, when you type your problem and then it shows you the solution, it was rather more confusing. Moreover, this application can't no longer solve linear inequalities in two variables. Well, the last version was STILL the best out of everything.",Negative
photomath,Education,I will give it 1â­ Because it can't solve this problem ðŸ™„......3x + 6y < 12 You should update this problem soonâ˜ºï¸,Negative
photomath,Education,"It used to be the best app ever before the update, and I used it whenever I needed help with solving a math equation. But with the new feature, I have to have premium before I can see the break up of steps to solve the expression. This affected me a lot because I no longer understand how to solve the math problems since all i get is a rough few steps n an answer. Also I can't afford to get premium, so this app isnt that great anymore.",Negative
photomath,Education,"The app used to be good until the updated, removing the ""show options"" feature that you have to pay for. This would be fine if it was SUBSCRIPTION based, but ideally it should be free like it was before. I don't know what the devs were thinking locking off features that were previously free.",Negative
photomath,Education,Sign In To Get Unlimited Solving Steps!! *Tries To Sign In (hoplessly)* Check Your Internet Connection!! REALLY?? The Latest Update Ruined It All. What If I Told You I Need To Run Photomath Offline?!? Please Bring Back Offline Mode WE NEED IT!!! WHAT IF I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT YOU TO TRACK MY USAGE AND DATA ???? I GOT IT !! WHY DON'T I EASILY USE AN ALTERNATIVE APP. OR AN ALTERNATIVE STORE THAT WILL LET ME DOWNLOAD AN OLDER VERSION OF PHOTOMATH!!!!,Negative
photomath,Education,"Oh my god!!!! They have made it so bad!!!! It is worse than ever................these new updates are killing me.They are so bad..................It was very very very helpful earlier but now it is GARBAGE. The automatic question recognition was something ultimate but now when the shutter has came its just like other apps. The step by step explaination is also now gone. Please remove this new update. And a word of advice for the creators ""Your bussiness will go down""",Negative
photomath,Education,"This app used to be great, but it just auto updated and basically took away the only useful feature I needed. In the problem solving steps, instead of offering to show the steps, there's now a button that says ""explain how"". Clicking on it I just get a prompt saying I need to upgrade to unlock that feature. I was under the impression that core features were supposed to be free. Guess not anymore. Uninstalling; I could just bug my professor for the money I already pay.",Negative
photomath,Education,"Used to love this app until the new update. Now it basically only shows the answers, which is useless as the best feature was that it showed step by step how to solve the problem, it is now very frustrating as parts of the solution remain unexplained. If only a one off payment was required I would definitely consider paying, but as a broke student a monthly fee is just not realistic :( very disappointing. For Â£9 a month I'll pay for Netflix and watch that instead of doing the homework.",Negative
photomath,Education,"I love this before because it is very helpful, but when they updated it to have PhotoMath Plus, this give us hard time",Negative
photomath,Education,"Literally no one here has $10 lying around for PhotomathPlus. All the responses from the team talk about how it's needed for fees for AI tutorials, etc. However, Im assuming that what we need the most (answers/COMPLETE steps) would still be free to run right? That was how it was done before the update. Could there be a setting option to just turn off all the fancy stuff and go back to no ads/complete steps w/o using money? Or just create another app (that costs $ to download) w/ the new things.",Negative
photomath,Education,"I would say the recent update ruined this app. It feels less refined and the new styling is just not my thing. In the old version you're able to insert two functions and a graph will show you where it intersects, but now the graph will simply not show. Also, i like it when i used to be able to simply slide to move from camera and calculator. Overall, the old version seems way better than this version.",Negative
photomath,Education,"App used to be the best, now its stuck behind a pay wall. Want to learn how to solve the problems? Pay money. For others looking to bypass the paywall: Goto apkmirror and download version 6.0.1 (The version right before the crappy update) >>Android Only<< >>Don't forget to turn off auto update.<< Developers clearly don't know their consumer base.",Negative
photomath,Education,"Before the new update, it was the best app for this purpose but now after the update, I think that it's the worst app because I was using it to solve problems and to remember how it was solved. After all, the main problem is, its premium version which unables us to see how the question is solved. So it is humble request to solve this issue because all the stundents can't pay the cost for premium one.",Negative
photomath,Education,editing my 5 star review (which I posted a year ago) because the new update made the app horrible. Photomath was one of the best app for learning math and making it easy; but now? Too many adds have completely spoiled the experience and what used to be free is now paid? Horrible experience. The old photomath was the best. Dev team please do something about this.,Negative
photomath,Education,This app used to be the best thing in explaining steps in problems that my online class couldn't even explain well. The function that explains the reasoning of problems was free until the recent update which now has a pay wall behind it. You might as well get a real tutor instead. The app now has ads that slow you down. This clearly is a money grab now. The devs lack the care of the students now based on the unhelpful copy and paste responses to these reviews.,Negative
photomath,Education,"This new update is actually horrible. I hate how the default page is now the camera, because half the time I don't use the camera since it can be unreliable. Not to mention it keeps turning on my camera which is annoying. And that's not even all. This app used to be great at calculating, now all if I put (1-x-6x^2)^5, all it does is reorder the terms, it doesn't expand at all. If I enter it the ordered way, it shows a uselesa graph. Please Photomath, go back to being a great app.",Negative
photomath,Education,This app used to be great but after an update it became plauged with constant advertising everytime you take a snap of a problem an ad pops out also for most solution to view the steps it asks for their premium membership something that was free before... and a core concept of the whole app since in most cases the process is what you are looking for.,Negative
photomath,Education,"I hate the new update!!!! Can you guys please change it back to how it was. Because in the new one you can even choose which method you can use to solve a quadratic equation, in the old one you could choose. Most of the equations i scan show me that they can't solve the problem,even easy ones...this was hardly the case before but,now it's very often that i get that message. PLEASE,CAN IT BE BACK TO HOW IT WAS!!!!!",Negative
photomath,Education,"Before the update, they used to explain how to solve equations. I can't understand the ideas of solving just because of the *photomath plus* that is a paid subscription for explanations. They used to explain for free, and now they're telling us to pay! I'd rate this a half-star since they deserved it. I'm not even 18 to have myself a credit card. Greedy idiots. Edit: I just realized that Photomath devs are copying responses to who's disliking the subscription idea. No direct communication I see.",Negative
photomath,Education,"I'm in Algebra 2 and struggle a bit with math, and this app helps me a lot in regards to understanding the problems I'm trying to work on and understanding the concepts we're trying to learn. That said, the recent update has put a paywall behind solving different math problems called ""Photomath Plus"". It no longer gives the steps to solving certain equations and only shows the answer, which is useless to me. The paywall too is ludicrous, considering most who use this app are students.",Negative
photomath,Education,"What happened to the old layout and design of the app??? To be honest I've been very disappointed with the new updates, which seemingly degrades the quality of the app, which I am sorry to say. If you want to stay on top, then fix your updates !!! :<< I hope that you place proper actions and countermeasures to solve this.",Negative
photomath,Education,"Dear sir/ma'am, When I first downloaded this app,it only scan problems and gives correct answers. But after an update,it acquires camera button to take picture to solve the problem. But that camera is not taking pictures properly. And now I have known that it can't solve ratio and proportion. Kindly fix these problems to let me to give you 5 star rating because we all know that it is the best app to solve mathematical problems Thanking you, Yours faithfully, Your app user.",Negative
photomath,Education,DISABLE CAMERA AUTO FOCUS. The update that added auto focus to the camera ruined the app. The camera will almost never focus probably. This makes it impossible to solve problems from a photo. That was the one feature that made this app better than its competitors and now it's gone. I loved this app before that update and everything else is great. Please add a way to disable the auto focus.,Negative
photomath,Education,"I got this a few years ago for the beginning of high school and it was so amazing! It walked you through all the steps and evrything. However now with the new update you need to upgrade to ""premium"" which costs money. Can't do anything now without paying. Great app if you're rich and lazy though.",Negative
photomath,Education,"the new camera update is awful, it takes ages for it to take a focused picture. It was so much better when the lense scanned the math problem directly than this new update where you need to take the picture for the app to scan the math problem. Please fix that, it was the coolest feature of the app, but now it's the worst one.",Negative
photomath,Education,"PHOTOMATH IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE!!! I've been using Photomath since before, it has helped me in a lot of assignments. But after the update, all solutions are locked until you payed a fee. I'd give you developers ni stars if I could, PLEASE RETURN BACK THE OLD PHOTOMATH!!! I DON'T WANT THOSE AI UPDATES YOU ADDED!!! THE PREVIOUS VERSION WAS BETTER CAUSE MOST OF US USERS CAN AFFORD THINGS",Negative
photomath,Education,In the beginning it was good but with the recent update which adds in the pay to use well solution I find this unsatisfying... As a student myself I agree that it's useful but the fee for the important extra info was and still is a bad idea. Hope you change back to normal Until then I'll keep it a 1 star rating.... And the response is as usual... Blatantly copied and then pasted... Disappointed,Negative
photomath,Education,"The recent updates ruined the app. It takes longer to open, it's harder to type in the equations. I get that the whole point is to take a pic and get the app to solve it automatically, but the majority of the time I just want to write my equation and play with it, and Photomath is still the best for this. It would be best if it was faster to open and easier to type in equations.",Negative
photomath,Education,"App was amazing until interface update. And now what do we have? Developer wrote in his blog that it's supposed to be free. Annoying ads, premium functions, laggy interface, camera detect is disgusting, dont even work properly. App was so well but now it ruined with help of your greed and bad updates.",Negative
photomath,Education,Photomath is a good app before but now photomath bought a new update with photomath plus whis is not good because people cannot afford such a high price like 840 rupees for 1 month. Without this photmath was the best app. Because of this new photomath plus we are not properly expkained any sum . Also the free trial for 7 days is fake,Negative
photomath,Education,"dont like the new update were u manually take a picture of your problem, it just makes everthing slower, opposed to when you just had to scan the problem and the answer would just appear at the bottom. i wish i could just revert it back. that scan feature was the thing that really made this app stand out from the rest, now its just like the others horrible",Negative
photomath,Education,"Photomath turned into dogsh*t after the lastest updates. They are now charging money for step explanations, something majority of the user uses the app for. The developers of the application say that they keep the core of the app free. WELL PHOTOMATH DEVELOPERS, WE USE THE DAMN EXPLANATIONS THAT U ONCE HAD FOR FREE. THE EXPLANATION IS THE CORE OF THE APP. No one, not a single soul wants ur damn AI stuff.",Negative
photomath,Education,I love this app!!. The best!! UNTIL THE NEW UPDATE :( please remove the subscription or make the subscription keeping in mind students. $1-2 dollar a month is adequate. Thinking about catering to the masses and not the rich braty spoilt kids who dont study but have money to pay for this app. Last min studying . think about those who are in serious need. Whos parents or guardains cannot afford to give a decent education and have to find their own ways. Use your skills to benefit the world.,Negative
photomath,Education,"Updates are supposed to improve user experience, I was using photomath a lot before update, and it helped me not only by solving problems, but mostly it showed me how to solve them, and since new update everything is hidden behind paywall. I guess it's time to find another app.",Negative
photomath,Education,"I love this app or at least I use to. Since the recent update, it has destroyed what made it a good application. I know you're trying to get money, but you ruined this app for me with the update. The free version shouldn't take away the one things that has helped it's users just because it wants money. And honestly 10$? Jesus Christ, that's ridiculous.",Negative
photomath,Education,The new update is wores it's only can scan one,Negative
photomath,Education,It was perfectly fine before the update. Now you can't even get how the problem was solved without paying for it. I got this app to help me with math because it was free and helpful and now all it does is solve it for me instead of helping me understand how figure it out. Don't get it if you want actual help with math.,Negative
photomath,Education,It was all good but after the latest update i started to experience complications. I can't scan equation because the camera is upside down even though my phone and the equations are in a straight position. I have to manually write the equations and it's taking my time. pls fix this thanks.,Negative
photomath,Education,"Ruined the app after the update, it used to help a lot, where I couldnt understand some problems through other apps or sites, photomath was my go to app and I spoke highly of it to anyone I knew that struggled with math, now I'm uninstalling the useless app since it dkesnt explain what I need unless I pay for it. Definitely posting to my social media to let known the decline in quality because the devs want an extra buck. ðŸ˜” If you're gonna pay for an app, get the better quality with mathway.",Negative
photomath,Education,"I used to use photo math a lot. But with this new update I can barely even get the camera to focus and get the picture of the problem. And when it does focuses it will load and then go back to being blurry. Anyone seeking for an app to help you, THIS IS NOT THE ONE!!!",Negative
photomath,Education,The app was very helpful when you can get it to open. I've uninstalled and reinstalled tried to update and nothing works. Also the new camera update is annoying. It takes a long time to load and often cannot read the problem.,Negative
photomath,Education,Before Premium I could always see flaws in my thinking. Now it only shows what to do without actually explaining why. It was best app out there before this update. Now it's just not worth it.,Negative
photomath,Education,"Last update completely fuðŸ¤¬ked me, now the camera won't open no matter what the help option says it worked great and completely screwed me over the next. Sony Xperia xa2 ultra H4213 power saver off no apps using camera have restarted still nothing. Just give me a link to roll back to when it was still working great.",Negative
photomath,Education,"This app used to be so great but the last updated made it disgusting. Do you want to understand how a problem was solved? Sorry, dear, pay first. I'm sure, you have a LOT of users from middle and high school who do not have their own money but still want to undersrand solutions. So do I. Thank you for the wonderful experience in the past and great disappointment in the present.",Negative
photomath,Education,What the hell. Whatever I experienced was worst. After the update it become the worstestest. I am not behind insulting you but it continuously repeats the same answer even when their is no kind of relationship in the question and the answer. I hope you will fix it or some more will have the most critical review ever .,Negative
photomath,Education,"I always get disturbed by the feature that has been updated. I hate the 'turning on' of camera at the beginning. It wastes most of my time doing nothing and waiting for the system to correspond. You should add a setting in app that the turning on of camera would be controlled. If one wants, they should turn off the feature according to their own will. Thankyou",Negative
photomath,Education,"Used to be a great app, when the system use only scanning math problems, which is faster than the latest update. Taking picture of the math problem and waiting for how long is frustrating... And the answer didn't even appeared.",Negative
photomath,Education,This update is very bad. I will never use camera. Because not correctly seeing the things. I didnt have much time to wait open the app. I should have 100 in math subject. Some parts arent available ex . First derivative test. And second derivative test. Rates of change. And optimization .,Negative
photomath,Education,Its a great app but the recent update has ruined the camera. Before it would give a guess when the camera was hovered over a question and the camera would focus nicely but the recent update has removed the preview function and ruined the camera as it will unfocus when i take a pic but refocus when i m not which is extremely annoying. Update: they ve made it worse somehow. The styling is their attempts to be more like social media but photomaths purpose is a calulator not where i go post selfies,Negative
photomath,Education,Almost all the problems I'm trying to get help on need to be payed so I can see the steps. Why would I pay so much when i can just install an alternative. I really wonder how many actually subscriptions this app has made since the really money grabbing update. The only reason I even used this app was for the explanation otherwise just getting the answer does not help anyone learn which was the purpose of this app right? What happened to free education for all?,Negative
photomath,Education,"I've had this app for about a year and I've never been more disappointed than I had been with the most recent update. To my knowledge the purpose of this app is supposed to help people solve a math problem. If you create a paywall for the steps in solving that problem, the app is no longer about helping people, it is about getting money. I used to love this app, if something isn't broken don't fix it, so why did you fix it?",Negative
photomath,Education,"Well, I really liked this app at the beginning. It helped me in my exams, in fact it was like my mathematics teacher but after the update it has become useless without money.... Sorry, but it's no helping now.",Negative
photomath,Education,This app used to be very helpful before the new update it helped me many times but after the update it started demanding for subscription i.e to pay money for the features which were previously available but now it demands money for explaining the steps too.,Negative
photomath,Education,Latest update destroyed the app. I used to be able to find the simplified and exact forms of an answer on the same page but now it doesn't even do that. Would rather stick the the older version that was MUCH easier to use and find what I'm looking for.,Negative
photomath,Education,"This was a great app. But the latest update just made everything too complicated, and It also doesn't show you the graph anymore. I love the developers and hope they restore the previous version.",Negative
photomath,Education,"The app was amazing. Except that everything about previous update made it very frustrating to use. I know developers won't listen to my review, but at least they should have conducted testing sessions to see live user feedback...",Negative
photomath,Education,"The app was much more better before that update..Before I got the explanations for each steps now I have to pay for learning something like man I'm broke but I still want to know how they solved the system of equations cause damn I'm confused and my teacher isn't helping at all.. Edit: even now they will give the answers and wont explain, how the hell should I know how they got 4, I'm uninstalling this app now cause all they want is money bruh not cool",Negative
photomath,Education,"You guys made a photomath plus, which I don't like because when i do a mult digit decimal multiplication, it won't let me cause of the plus. Can you please change this because me and my sister use photomath and we need it. This is a bad update, this change this somehow. Please reply.",Negative

photomath,Education,Hate the spp after the new update! The new UI takes too long to recognize the picture of the equation I took. This wasn't a problem until a recent update. Hope Photomath fixes it!,Negative
photomath,Education,It was all great before the update.. now it sucks! You HAVE TO take a picture of the equation if you want to solve it.. WHY?! it used to be instant without any need to take pictures.. it was just scanning.. now you gotta work your ass off to get the solution.. IT WAS WAY BETTER.. RETURN IT PLEASE!,Negative
photomath,Education,I hate ur new camera pic update!!!! I want the old search up answer feature that u had when u put it to where the equation was and it would instantly answer it with ez asap but now I think u should delete that snap shot feature where the camera starts to blur when u take the photo. it's just terrible. I think u need to fix ur app back the way it was but this new feature is still annoying. can u remove it and put photomath back to its original self. thank u,Negative

I was always happy with the application and the friendly nature of the interface, alongside the useful content. However, after using the app for many years, I decided to try out the Duolingo Plus TRIAL to test out the features. After starting the trial, a few days in when I wanted to cancel my trial before being charged, I found that I was unable to do so. I would receive an error message saying no subscription was found.I repeatedly attempted to cancel my subscription to no avail. And today, I was charged for the monthly fee because I was unable to cancel the trail. As a long time user and advocate of Duolingo (over 5 years) I am extremely disappointed and will not recommend this service to anyone at all anymore because of this fraudulent behavior the company has engaged in. A freemium application that encourages users to try out the Duolingo Plus and placing obstacles preventing users from canceling the subscription. As a long-time lover and advocate of Duolingo I am saddened to have to write this review and find it disheartening that the company I love and share with my friends is not what I had thought it to be.
