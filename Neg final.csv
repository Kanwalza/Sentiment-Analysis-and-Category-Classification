Wattpad ,Education,"First, I'm an English teacher myself and studied in the US. I had my native friends test this app out and they didn't even pass. Secondly, a pronunciation app itself is not an equivalent of a complete english learning system or program. It is certainly a key part but only after you already have listening, speaking, vocabulary then there's no actual fluency (not to mention slangs and idioms and real life expressions). YouTube has all the pronunciation tutorials you need for free.",Negative,PI
Wattpad ,Education,"Absolutely useless app. I gave this app another person with beginner English level, and this person read with pauses, mispronounced almost each word, made stress on wrong syllables. And how do you think, what the result of this test was? 80% native speaker! This is silly, this app doesn't work. I see many likes here, but it's because all these people feels themselves a great English speakers (and it is not truth). The only thing that works, you can compare your phrases with native speaker (the app record each your attempt and you can hear yourself). But you can do the same without this app, just use youtube and sound recorder from your phone (and do it for free, without premium subscription, that you need for using of this app).",Negative,PI

Wattpad ,Education,"Please be aware that the app quietly increased the price of monthly subscription from $3.99 to $11.99 and yearly subscription from $29.99 to $74.99. There used to be frequent offers to get the yearly subscription for as long as $23.99! Also please note that there are frequent price fluctuations, and often the price for the same service can vary right within the app. Right now, I can subscribe for yearly subscription for $74.99, $59.99 or $37.49 simply depending on where you click inside the app.",Negative,PI
Wattpad ,Education,"This app works with some algorithms. If you say wrong any word, you gotta say it more than 10 times. Specially say any word incorrect twice in a row. After that even you will say the word absolutely clearly the algorithm will find a mistake. Even tenth attempt is true, if you will move forward and say the same word twelfth time, it will be a wrong answer. Good app for most of Asian people who don't know the correct pronunciations, after eleventh attempt they'll reach it and feel satisfied.",Negative,PI
Wattpad ,Education,This is worst app I have ever used because of you pronounce a word wrong then also it do it right. This app can destroy your vocabulary and pronunciation.

Wattpad ,Education,"Totally useless. It randomly recognizes or rejects what you saying, there is no logic behind it. Had been using for a while but seen no improvement. Doesn't show you how to produce some sounds. Just some useless text.

Last update: Thank you for the response. Teaching American pronunciation is totally fine for whoever is interested on it. The title here in google play however indicates that you support the original English Accent (English originates from England).

Wattpad ,Education,"My speech is absolutely similar to the sample, but because the program cuts my words incorrectly (for example I say your, but the program recognises it as yu, basically it doesn't recognise the words properly) , it doesn't even highlight my actual mistakes.

Elsa,Education,doesn't move to the next question. my app is updated and i tried several times.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,Its trash cuz it doesn't show me the questions I have to be constantly switching from app to app and by the time I'm back in the app time is up don't download this Quizziz is wayy better.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,Snowdog Gaming it messed up the game too much. website is much better. I am deleting.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,The UI was completely unresponsive. Would only occasionally detect a button press. Missed out on answering a lot of questions because of it. Tried to rejoin but wasn't allowed as the user name was already taken.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,It is the worst game ever I could never login so I am leaving a bad review like I am so just just ¤¤¤,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,the touch buttons are very unresponsive,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"The way this tool decides the winner is wrong. Those with less correct answers wins a quiz. Funny tool with bugs. Even if it is a live quiz with timer attached, time should come into play only in the case of tie for those users who answered in time. So going by this game's logic 0 correct answers out of 10 in 1 minute is better than 5 correct answers in 2 minutes within the allotted time of 3 minutes. Many wrong answers in quiz too.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"The app stays in portrait mode which means I can't see the questions, only the coloured boxes to answer. My friend can view in landscape and the questions show on his phone.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"I HATE IT!!! The first time I got this app it was so much fun until today , it suddenly ask for a pattern and the pattern changes EVERY SEVEN MINUTES!!! I really like kahoot , but please don't put the pattern ! Then I will change it to five stars.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"I tried using it in my class and my student experience problems in using it. all of them can't see the question, only choices is available. I tried it again because I belive it is just a simple technical problem but still I can't see the questions only choices is availble. I waisted my time encoding questions.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"Useless. If you're thinking of using this for some company quiz, don't bother. Most contestants phone show the wrong question for the one that's being asked on the organiser screen, making it mostly impossible to play.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,First when I installed the app it was amazing. But now it's not allowing me to do the quiz only. It is not showing any question. It has become the worst app nowadays. I hope that you will understand my problem and try to resolve it. Please do some bug fixes in the app. I'm very disappointed with this app nowadays!!ððððððð¤¢ð¤®,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"Terrible. I put in my questions, and was then told that typing answers requires an update to the subscription, but there is no way to upgrade. Why not explain what upgrades you need before purchasing, not after",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,Worst app ever seen even single star â­ should not be given especially in the case when you are giving a formative assessment or at the time when marks are taken into count.The main problem is we can't handle it on single device as soon as question is popped on the teacher's screen as we are changing tab since no options are available on Kahoot screen only those coloured boxes.Technically it is not feasible giving those coloured boxes instead of options. Worst app one should never use it.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"Worlds worst app, quizizz is better than this app as we have to see questions from the hosts screen and answer, while even though quizizz has questions, it has types of musics as well as powerups. Also when I quit to home screen to see the HOSTS SCREEN, IT FREEZES AND WHEN I CLICK ON THE BUTTON IT DOES NOT WORK. REALLY QUIZIZZ IS BETTER",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"seems kinda fake. graphics are not realistic at all. not much action, and seemed slow at parts. the story campaign was alright right, although I enjoyed the twist at the end. did not expect Rober Downey Jr. to come in at the end good surprise.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,This app sucks when you are on mobile you want to add a picture but then you can only do getty images otherwise you have to download it instead of adding a search bar to find pictures without having to download can you please fix it.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"Simply did not work... players could not get the app to display in landscape mode and were unable to see any questions. Seems like this could be awesome, yet it fails to deliver. Multiple reviews note same/similar issues....",Negative,FI

Elsa,Education,I did not like I am sitting near to my net which is very fast and your app is telling that it is telling that retrying again and again stupid.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,I actually really like this app but I dont like the premium thing . Technically whats the point if you need premium for 90% of what the app is for. If you want 5 stars from me you'll have to take away the premiumð I do not recommend ð,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,This app is terrible. You might as well do it online as it constantly tells you you've disconnected. Then it freezes. This app has been constantly sabotaging my grades turning me from an A+ student to a B despite me getting all the answers right.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,its too bad always say that your network is bad and the question doesn't show that to be answered please fix the same and it is very glitchy and laggy,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,It does not allow me to put my own pin so I can play with family.And It was really just if you want to play online and not on the app itself if you want to play on the app and create a draft with your own pin you have to pay.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,Better if the questions appeared on my screen as well instead of just answers.. its annoying to keep looking at the other screen,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,it didnt work. all I could see was shapes I couldnt see the questions!!,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"Great ideea, problem as I try to have a game with scouts and they can't see the questiona or the answers, only the colourful squares. Hopefully the developer will sort this problem out.",Negative,FI

Elsa,Education,Subscribed to pro version to be able to create a game and nothing changed. Garbage and expensive,Negative,FI

Elsa,Education,the stupid fact the teacher use this as a study crutch is annoying,Negative,FI

Elsa,Education,WORST GAME EVER TOO LAGGY WHEN I PRESS AT LEAST 1 BUTTON AND WHEN IN TRAINING I CAN'T TAP IT DOESN'T RESPOND EVEN MY SYSTEM DOESN'T RESPOND TO TAPS,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,This is a terrible game I don't get how people think this is fun it's just a bunch of stupid quzzes,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"This app used to be super convenient. Having the app already there and easy to start up was perfect. But as they saw the opportunity to make some money, they took it. And it is absolutely ridiculous. Everytime I went to enter a game pin THREE different adverts for their new services popped up. And not only that it often times messed it up and I had to reenter the game pin for a second time. Its horrid. Stick to the moblie website. It's much better!",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,Not worth paying the money. They dont make the plans very obvious. I wanted to upgrade so I opted for the standard plan. Only to discover that the standard plan only allows you to use two types of questions and it'll cost an extra Â£42.49 to upgrade it again for 1 month. A couple of months ago my sister only paid Â£8.99 and could access all features. They dont make it clear that the standard plan is basically useless and you can't do that much more than when you were on the free plan.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"kahoot devs don't respond to enhancement requests, the app purposely puts buttons in confusing places to send you where you don't want to go",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,It is worst app . it take 10 minutes in opening.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,Questions cannot be viewed on phone. Unless the organizers' screen is shown.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,you can't see the corresponding answers and questions just colors,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"The fee trial is not a free trial as expected. I spent a lot of time creating a quiz to test out the app, now I cannot even play it to test it without subscribing. It is just 14 days free on the subscription which you have to supply you credit card for!! The answers can only be in one line of text, making formatting difficult. The image does not leave much space for the question and answers, so the fonts are tiny, difficult to read and in a horrible font.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,It does not show the this that I want,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,Doesn't work on my Xiomi MI Mix 2. I used it about 1.5 months ago to make questions for a test. It was a good way to study. I got a high score. I had another test about a week ago. I worked on questions for about 1.5 weeks. Made over 300. I tried to play on study mode. It would take me to the quiz screen and freeze. Support was terrible. They offered no advice. They asked me to perform the troubleshooting I'd already tried on my own. After I had told them what I tried- frustrating.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"I was charged incorrectly for the whole year. When I started trial for 7 days, kahoot site informed me that I may be charged for a month. But now I see, my credit card was charged with whole year subscription. I don't want this subscription. I am really poor and it's a big amount for me. Please refund my money as soon as possible. This is very wrongful deed done by kahoot. I was not aware of the fact that you may charge me for the whole year.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"This app is absolute garbage it barely works let alone works at all. We use this for school and it's always glitchy and bad, the most recent case of this is when were doing a quiz on it and I'm first place and on a streak through the entirety of it, then halfway through it says trying to reconnect check your wifi so I check it and guess what FIVE BARS! it finally connects right as the question starts and I click nothing but it says I chose wrong I'm barely scraping the surface here. would rate 0",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"Installed, played through a quiz that had 3 questions with incorrect answers, and the service has no system in place for reporting these. Meaning this quiz app is completely useless because any quiz can just have absolute BS answers and you have no way of bringing this to the attention of the people running the service. Ridiculous. It's a basic feature ffs. Get it together Kahoot.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"Absolutely the worst game i have ever tried. Yes i can create the quiz, but i cant host it to anyone. I created a 10 question game and tried to host it to others and i couldnt. At first i thought i did something wrong, so i recreated the same questions and answers. It still didnt work. It was really sad to see that all of my effort didnt turn out to be anything. But when i created a 3 question quiz, i could host it really easily. If i cant host 10 question quizes, then why is there the option.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,connection is bad,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"I accidentally purchased a one year subscription instead of the free trial. I immediately contacted them an hour after the purchase, upon knowing I did the wrong purchase. They would not cancel my subscription and refund me what I paid. They told me to contact Google, but Google said the refund was on merchant's side. Now I have to pay the full amount of a year subscription for an app that I'm not intending to use so much.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,It will allow you to put in the work but not tell you until your finished that you cannot create a quiz unless you pay for it. Be straight up and transparent. I'm not paying for a month minimum when I only wanted to create something fun for the kids. It is a one off kind of thing. Sneaky.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"Customer service terrible! I ran the 7-day trial decided it wasn't for me so I chose to cancel. I went to my email and used the provided ""Manage Billing"" link and clicked cancel and all was over according to the email I received back. 7 days later I'm charged $120 for the annual fee, I look on the site and found my account still active. I contact Customer support and they tell me I NEVER cancelled even after sending screenshots of my dated cancel confirm! They refuse to refund me, what a scam!",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,Epic fail. Since I couldn't leave feedback on site that I had accessed webinar where we were engaging in a game of trivia using this God forsaken site/app because window that site was open in closed on me when I tried to leave feedback for it there I am writing to say this was lousy and not user friendly. Not sure why other people on that webinar had no trouble but whatever. Another nice wrinkle to ruin the day and even the weekend.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,After a long downloading & install time. The game (PIN:563828) was played on a product launch and stuck on question 6 of 10. Do improve on the game capability before using it publicly especially on electronic product launch which can caused negative impact on the brand. Not even 24 hours but it's time to uninstall. Thank you,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"Biggest issue : I wasted hours, and Â£9, creating a quiz for Friday night virtual drinks with friends but some of the questions don't show for some people. That doesn't work for a competitive quiz because it's not equal. Other issues : None of questions show at all on the phone if you choose 'Host Live', so it can't be used for virtual quizzes. So, rather than everyone going through the questions at the same time and chatting about it, everyone has to do it separately instead",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"Super annoying. It is impossible to buy a one month license w.o ending up as a subscriber. Kahoot makes this process hard on purpose. Further they make it hard to cancel, I ended up paying for a month I don't need, then found out even finding the settings to terminate was hard. I will not come back to this app. Very, very frustrating!",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"The app keeps dropping when I play with the Super Carlin Bros. Constantly timing out whether I get answers correct or incorrect. Not sure why they say there is a 2000 person limit, when it constantly drops players even when they get in. Should definitely change apps until Kahoot's servers can handle the traffic it advertises.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"I loved this app until there was premium. If i dont buy premium, i only can save my quiz in draft and i cant even host my own quiz. While i m making my quiz, i cant put multi select, change points and even most of the pictures must buy premium. So please remove this premium thing. I really dont like to put bad comments but if i have to, i will put. Very pls remove the premium. There r other ways of earning money.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"It is so stupid that you can only play 3 questions in a single round and have to keep clicking to go to the next round. Why can't there be some options in settings, or a settings in general to change it up. It gets so annoying to keep changing it over and over. Also, why can't there be a button for saving and exiting the game?",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"would be great, but keeps freezing",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"I would rate five stars, but the loading screens in practice are around 7 seconds long after each question. I used this app to help me study, but the loading times feel like sandpaper to the brain. Other than loading times, 5 stars for accessibility and interface.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"What the f****ing app, I wasted a lot of time just making a kahoot and then it got disappeared.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"Used to be good! Not anymore! You have to pay just to post a kahoot quiz!! What's the point of having it if I cant use it! I'm so mad! I used to be able to at least post the quizzes without the upgrade but, now the app is useless without premium! Please fix this! ¡",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,This could have been great but instead turned out to be trying to harvest users through a challenge. I wanted a simple game for family play but it did not work as advertised because the challenge requires everyone to install the app. So I have uninstalled it!,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,The questions dont appear on time,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,I purchased this app on a years subscription bearing in mind it had a 14 day free trial. I cancelled the subscription less than 24hrs after setting this app up. It wasn't what I expected. The company still took full payment of 86.99 and have not refunded me a penny. Disgusting. I WANT MY MONEY BACK IN FULL I have consumer rights!!! Just an update got a refund but had to go through Google play. Still should happen automatically you shouldn't be left to chase it. Thanks to kahoot for their guidance,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,Very slow. Huge delays with what is happening with other people playing. Eg times out before the question is given. Even tried refreshing but no good. The answers time out way before the the others players as well.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"I bought premium Kahoot and it become slower than the free one. After I posted challenge to my students, I cant see how many people hv done it. It didn't update the progress, I can't see their reports. I hope u can fix it immediately, I didn't pay 70 dollar for this poor quality.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"This app won't work I pressed the ""enter pin"" button and everytime its says "" something went wrong sorry for the inconvenience"".I tried restarting my phone I unistalled then redownloaded the app but it said the same thing over and over again do yourself a favor and never ever download this stupid, usless app. I have a test i need to do that is due on Sunday and the teacher put the test on this app how am I to get a grade now thanks alot kaboot .",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,this game is rigd,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,This is so stupid it's the worst app ever now to do anything I have to pay premium I already know if I put in my credit card pin to do the free 14-day trial is going to not even tell me that my 14 day trial is done and just charged me and it's just so bad kahoot now is just trying to get so much money just don't download this unless you want to waste your money on something I'm warning you all I used to love this but not anymore this app is only good if you want to waste $14 every month,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,It was horrible after I played one round it would not let me do anything else not even play another round.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,Once you get out by malfunction or anything you can't get back in. All it does is frustrate kids. Add the function to get back in at anytime! Every time this is used same thing happens.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,I love this app BUT you shouldn't limit the characters! It's a great way to study but our harder questions tend to be longer than the characters allowed! Please change that and I'll be more than glad to change it to 5 stars,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"The base a idea of group quizzing/trivia is good, but the fundamentals are flawed. This has out grown the idea of a learning/classroom app and should either make a social trivia version or stay the same and be devoured in the most capitalistic way by another, superior app.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"Flat out doesn`t work. Can`t run the game from my tablet, it forces a tab open in google chrome, which is where i have to run the game from. Problem with this is that the images accompanying the quiz do not display when im running from the chrome mobile browser. I need to run from the tablet because that is what is hooked up to the display.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"Stressing, people with slow computers or devices are extremely angry not just at the device but the creator for being a unsmart person BECAUSE THERE IS A DONE BUTTON WHEN YOUR ABOUT TO GET A REWARD, AND WHAT DOES THE DONE BUTTON DO, GIVE YOU NOTHING FOR JUST HARD WORK! SO one star and because the game lets you type anything with no filter, i did not try myself or anyone but still NO FILTER=BAD WORDS, and you will be left of with a unsafe game ;-; and a stressful on",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,This is very good qiz and giving opportunity to all thank you soo much for giving talllent,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"This is the the worse app I've ever seen. I can't login and I can't contact with customer service. I can't create a new account and when I try lost password, it did not work any time. I swear I changed my password 6 times and It didnt work. Any Kahoot employe can contact me ? ¡",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,Does not let you host a demo quiz to test out the real time performance before buying a membership. I suggest everyone get a Quizizz membership like my company opted for because they let you demo a few quizzes before deciding to buy it.,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,Dis is trash everytime you want to change your username it goes back to your old username can you FIX this game where you csn change your username,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"ZERO STARS! it never allows me to actually play! I've downloaded the app multiple times, I've tried to just play using the browser, every time it lets me enter the pin and once I do it says i need to download the app!! BUT I ALREADY HAVE??? when it actually works its a great game.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"It has the worst server !!! You can never enter a game pin at all in any case , at any internet speed ! It has the most unreliable connection gateway. Quite disappointed with the experience.",Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,This game is a pice of thrash it was so to create a game so i would not recommend it at all,Negative,FI
Elsa,Education,"The most frustrating and confusing quiz app ever. Kicked us out of the game twice before we actually managed to join. Many correct answers come out as incorrect, despite your answer matching perfectly with what the app displays as the correct answers. Sometimes it even times out before the question has ended. The scores make no sense and there is no cohesion with how your points are collated. So many bugs, it's absolutely absurd.",Negative,FI

Elsa,Education,"Can't really take Kahoot seriously as a quiz platform let alone a learning tool when you can't even switch off the atmosphere destroying, highly distracting, dreadful Casio synth music that automatically plays at full volume with every quiz whether you like it or not. Given that Kahoot is rolling out weekly updates and that users have been begging for this feature for months now this fully deserves its 1 star rating as a result.",Negative,FI

Elsa,Education,I paid for the monthly subscription and it didn't reflect on the app maybe due to connection issues.

Elsa,Education,answering sometimes lags,Negative,FI

Elsa,Education,"possibly one of the most boring games i've ever played. plus, it has many limits that ruin the experience. if your a teacher reading this, dont force it upon everyone, cause i can guarantee you some students will dislike kahoot. and if you dont have a projector, you wont be able to play it. for some reason the students have to read the questions off the board and not their own devices. for now, kahoot is a joke, wouldn't recommend it, although theres lots of other people that like it.",Negative,BR

I only have one account on Kahoot.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,Needs per review. There is incorrect information in this app. It is about the effectiveness of wearing masks to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. The app states that a mask won't keep you safe from catching the virus then states that if you have the virus wearing a mask will prevent you from transmitting it to others. I have not taken many quizzes so I can't say if they contain incorrect or confusing and misleading information or not. Please review the information posted in your app.,Negative,BR

Why is that even a thing? 2. No DarkMode ??!? I cant look at the screen for more than 1 second because of its brightness.. This great app and site REALLY needs Dark mode! it has been suggested before but there is no dark mode yet?? I couldn't understand math, no one would help me learn math, the teachers and my parents would try to explain me but i couldn't understand.

I would love to give this a great rating and I was really excited. Please look into this.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"Update removed scratchpad! We use this regularly in our house, but we are all used to being able to make notes or write out problems in the Khan scratchpad. It was essential. We have had to break out notebooks because the latest update removed the ability to use the scratchpad in a math problem. The button is no longer there. I didn't see removing this feature in the release notes either. Very disappointing.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"I have been using khan academy for years now, there are some great lessons that makes learning easy. Yet there are a lot of lessons that make me angry and upset. I watch the videos and do as told yet when I got to the question its doing it in a different way with no real explanation. Khan Academy has its ups and down but be aware of the fact that many students and parents are upset and stressed do to the app.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"One simple feature would make it 5 stars. Allow me to put videos on an sd card. I can't believe that this isn't a feature already; that's a standard thing. Almost all of my apps already support that. I was astounded when I found out that this app doesn't support putting downloads onto mounted sd cards. This will stay 1 star until this is added, because otherwise I'll just watch on my computer and save battery power and data.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"The website is great, but this app is useless. Not a single exercise loads, they all show a ""Error making task progress"" message. And YES, I already tried uninstalling and reinstalling it like you recommend to all the people complaining below. Has that actually fixed it for anyone? Is there a single phone that this app actually works properly on? I guess the only option is to use the site (which is slower), or maybe there's an older version of the app that actually works properly?",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"I rarely write reviews, if ever, and I had high expectations for this app. Don't get me wrong, Khan academy is a very informational website, good for learning. The app however is very buggy and glitchy, deletes my progress every few minutes and makes me restart, saying ""Error Making Task Progress"". Nothing wrong with my internet connection, just the app. If the app is fixed, I will change my review. Until then, save yourselves the headache and frustration and just use the website. Disappointed.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"I had this app eons ago and it worked. I just downloaded today it none of the courses are loading to due being ""unable to connect"", despite the fact that I'm in the very room where the Internet source is AND I've turned mobile data. Both cylinders running, the courses don't even try to load. I'll stick with the desktop version until this is fixed.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,In this app i want each country and their own language that is for ex i am an indian and i belongs to Andhra pradesh state and my mother tongue is telugu and i want to get teaching in my own mother tongue so plzz attach all the languages,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"Would really like to give it more stars but it won't even open on my android phone. I've tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it several times and it's still crashing before it even opens. I hope you guys can roll out some bug fixes on the next update, but I'm not even able to use it so I'm uninstalling it for now. I'm still able to use khan academy through the browser on my computer. But it would be nice to have it available on my phone. Update: still doesn't work. :(",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,You love stealing a my whole day why do you like it? I am never allowed to use any other things and only Khan academy. You like seeing kids being annoyed by your app? You steal all my time the games always say do Khan academy I hate this app,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"I'm a regular user and love this app but over the last day or so it wouldn't let me open the app and kept crashing. Now that I can open the app it keeps telling me to sign in or telling me I ""dont have any recent lessons"" which is making me nervous thinking it might have lost my progress. When I click on the lessons (exp. History) it says ""lesson can't be loaded, check network"" I'm on 4g and my signal is fine so I'm thinking it's a bug. I'd love for this to be fixed, It's my main schooling!",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"This app is very good for learning. But there may be something wrong please make changes for the wrong happening. When I am trying to get a quiz or tests given by our school, at that time this application is showing that """"""""error making progress"""""""""" I don't understood what they wanted to say. ðð",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"just installed the app. Had clicked on practice, and a pop-up ""Error making task progress. We encountered an error while attempting to make progress in this task; please try again later"" appeared. I waited, and tried again. Repeated the wait and try approach, a few more times. Received the same pop-up each time. Can't give more stars until I know what the app does, other than a pop-up error. (Not going to try uninstalling and reinstalling) If the app works later, more stars. If same issue...",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"I can log in from my laptop, but every time I try to log in from my tablet it says password incorrect. BS! I'm very careful typing it. I changed it. Same result. I uninstalled and reinstalled. Same result. Your app is broken! TO YOUR 05/06/2019 REPLY: You didn't read my review, because I was clear I'd already tried that. Also, I was able to install and login from phone, so only tablet is problem. ""This app is compatible with all of your devices."" Really?",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,Until the most recent update everything was working well. But now whenever I view any course I can watch the videos but when I got to take a subject or unit test the page comes up blank except for the green lightbulb icon. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling to no avail.,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,This app may be good but it's not like that what I want. I want to take solution of my text book problems like let me take a pic of my textbook numerical problems and sending that and immediately taking a detailed explanation of that solution. It should be free and if there is video lectures that will be great. Is like this type of any app for bcom final year then please inform me,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"This app was not for me, thats all i can say, it says 'you can learn anything' well you can't, its mainly about history, maths and science. This was 100% not what i was looking for, if you want to learn about a small range of topics this could be for you, but it just didn't do it for me, all the video's when really YouTube has many more learning resources",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"Changing my rating from 4 to 1, the new search function is terrible. Before it was quick and efficient to go through the years in a curriculum. Now I have to go here and there,select this and that, it's become tedious. Want to rollback to old update !!!",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"the app crashes when i try to open the semiconductors's glossary which as of now i can't find directly in the app but as i had watched those earlier, i still have an option to go back to them through the recent activity section but as soon as i click the the app crashes no matter that the content is available and the one video is still playing but what use it is of if i can't watch the desired video. please see to it asap. p. s: - both the physics(class XI india) and class 12 india are nowhere",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"Man does this app annoy me. Not only is it a pain to search stuff and find what you want, but it's a pain to download the lessons( it only downloads the videos. Not the articles to go with it. Smh man couldn't you make this actually useful) and it takes a heck of a lot of time to download the videos, which if I search on YouTube for the same exact videos and download them, it's a matter of seconds. I don't know why this app is so clunky and awkward to use. But please fix it.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,Tests randomly stop recognizing that you've entered an answer. Leaving the Check button disabled and unable to continue. Closing and reopening the app doesn't help. Reinstalling didn't help. Fortunately the web developers got it right. Used firefox and was able to continue answering questions without issue on the website.,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"This app is great for reviewing maths until you try any quizzes involving the evaluation of exponents, it doesn't allow you to answer as there is no option to type anything that remotely resembles a multiplication symbol (x, *, â¢ are all not options.) This wouldn't be so irritating if it weren't for the fact that I got the app solely because the website has the same problem, and the support team seems to not read feedback reports from users as I have received no response back.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"When I first dicovered that Khan Academy had an app, I was over the moon. I was so used to the websitr and I loved that. But then I got really disapointed because it would not even install. This is a humongous disapointment. Either fix this or pull it down. I am sorry Khan Academy but this is not good.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,It worked fine until one day it just wouldnt connect. I tried reinstalling and now it wont let me log in,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"The app is great ,very wide info but i have a problem accessing the video lessons,,everytime it stops working when i try to load the videos . I tried ur troubleshooting stuff of uninstalling and reinstalling the app but its only a waste of time It crashes MORE and MORE.Its supposed to be a learning app for everyone ,even if the android version is not updated...wth!!!",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,Answers labeled incorrect when the entered answer is the exact answer the app states it is. I thought I just couldn't remember any math instead of just having gaps. The videos are helpful when the problem structure in the video matches the one presented for solving.,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,This app is very good as compared to others there are test after completion of every topic and also revision test but one thing is that the language in which that person speaks in the videos is English but he speaks it likes that it isn't understandable even after turning on the captions. But yes if you downloaded this app for learning computer science it's the best but if for learning your course so you can face the above problem,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,this was wow..but the new update made things work slower.consuming soo much time to losd a thing.opens web browsers to select courses etc.prev one is better with an attractive display and easy to find everything.And when searching need to give everything correct.its not fixed even with tye jew update.i loved this but the new update is not tyat good.,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"I appreciate Khan Academy and all that Sal and the team do for us with learning. Sadly, this app is not intuitive. As someone who prides myself on being both a teacher and a student in Khan Academy, I am finding that being able to use the app on the teacher side does not work. I will continue to use Khan academy for my students, my children and myself and will hope that the app will get better for the teaching side.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"What the hell it's not opening the app and taking me back to the home page even after several attempt I am not able to open the app Edit: I have tried all the steps which you have written before only. There are 3 icons below of home, search and bookmark when it was on home it says unfortunately Khan academy has stopped and when I tapped the search button and searched videos I was able to access everything but the problem is takes me back to homepage when it is at home bar. Regards",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"I can tell that this app was made by people from top colleges like MIT because it makes me want to kill myself. The UI is atrocious, and there is no way to delete progress so if you mess up or mis-click (often because of UI) then you are stuck with that mistake and it constantly nags and mocks you about it.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"The recent UI update on march 28, 2019 has made using the app considerably more difficult. A lot of the time when you tap something you either get no response or a response after 10 seconds. Assignments take ages to load and many times I have found myself tapping things multiple times because of no response.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"I used Khan Academy before and I just have to say, I'm really disappointed at how buggy it is nowadays. My downloads are paused. I turned off my data for a second and the app crashed.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"I was really looking forward to trying this app. But, none of the practices or quizzes load. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but there was no difference. If anything, the app crashed more. 1) My name is not David. 2) I installed the current version 5.2.3 available for download.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"Very unresponsive app.. I often have a hard time scrolling down because the app doesn't respond, tapping buttons rarely has any effect, etc... It works perfectly on my computer but the app on mobile needs a lot of work.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"the first time i installed the app, it wouldn't log me in and even after it did, it wouldn't let me use it i.e it wouldn't load any of the courses even though the data connection was on. so i figured that it must be switched onto wifi connection only, but it wasn't. then i tried reinstalling the app. this time it wouldn't log me in AT ALL. saying that there was an issue in logging in with the google account. i tried all the other options but it still wouldn't give me access.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,I do not like this app because really what happens if they don't even help you try to help you they just make you do it I have better apps that I could teach children my childrenmy daughter really hate that I did it's making her like so disappointed that she has to do work and she loves work so you shouldn't really get this app is good if your children understand it and take their time on it but I just don't like it for 7 8 year olds summit year olds could do it but just not mine,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,since the new update there is a delay between me clicking on the video and it starting. and now it does not automatically go to the next in a series of videos. it also take a lot time to download besides having a very fast Internet connection ð please help.,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"At first, I tried use the website: wouldn't load anything. Then i installed this app in hopes to get my Calculus done, but this won't load either. It says that I need to check my connection and try again. I have internet access and it still won't let me. I even tried uninstalling the app and restarting my router, but nothing will works. Please fix!",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"Thought this was a great app until there was a ""trick question"" and by that i mean it had 2 answeres to select from that were 100% identical (and correct) but the first one i selected was ""wrong"" even though it matched the ""correct"" answer exactly. Now i dont know if i trust this app at all.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,It's getting buggier with every update. Requires a complete overhaul. Especially the video player. It cannot be that hard to design a bug free player. Edit: Tried reinstalling multiple times--didn't work. I've tried the app on other android devices but the results were no different from that of my phone. It's a broken app.,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,The app has gone buggy! I can't even open it. I have downloaded the app before and this the first time it's been like this. I tap on the app and it opens a white browser then goes back to my home screen.,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,The app is great but it seems to crash when I open it since I have updated it. Please fix it. I have already uninstall and install it again hoping it would properly function again but none of those methods work.,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"This apps seems to be in no way connected to the online version. Nothing is synced when logging in using the same account, rendering it useless. The website is wonderful, but the app simply does not function as it should.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,This app is SO stupid and SO BORING! It's not fair how your other app for little kids looks at least decent while ours is SO boring!!!,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"It has no features, one can't even save a page for offline viewing, you can't highlight and copy a text from it to your MsWord, no option to download page, poor search engines. It needs serious upgrades. I nevertheless appreciate the quality of information I get from it. But the app is not worth it.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,I use this app souly for math because we need to do it for school. We have to do 25% each quarter of the school year. You'd think that would be enough time right? For some it is and for people like me it isn't. I have friends that go up 5% in a half hour and finished their whole quarter early. People like me who are unlucky cant seem to go up 1% in a full hour. This website favors certain users and it's really annoying. Now the quarter is almost over and I only have 28 out of 50 done. Thanks Khan,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"I Wasn't even able to use it. Since I installed the app, I wasn't able to open it even once because it keep crashing. It would even load. I like Khan academy; it's great, but my experience with the app is not good.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"Assignments don't load, crashes upon opening some tasks too. This plays an important part of my maths course and now I'll be criticized for not using this. When the app is at fault. Uninstalled then reinstalled and the error persists.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"The app always shows that I am offline despite being online and the Internet in a Working condition. Even after multiple uninstalls and phone restarts, the app still says, I am Offline. Its very annoying and am Unable to use all the features of learning available in this app.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"This app is awful. It teaches you nothing and made me even more depressed than I already was. I was forced to use it for school's e learning, and the assignments were nothing like what I was taught, and the explanations didn't make any sense.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,It is pure ass. I put correct answers even backed up by the Web and it gives me it wrong. Also you can't stop and restart the lesson once you get something wrong forcing you to go through the wrong lesson. One of the worst learning apps. I do not recommend.,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,This app is rubbish! It insists that 7.4689 rounded to the nearest tenth is not 7.5 The site should document how the calculator is used since the app does not. Well neither the site or the app provide information. All this and repeated crashes too.,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"Why does it crash when loading before you have a practice quiz? It's irritating, I spend hours going through your videos, I understand very well and eager to test my understanding but it keeps on telling me to 'try again later' so FRUSTRATING ð¤",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,This app is very good and explanatery it makes learning easy for me and the way the explainer explains it there would be no doubt,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,I can't found the login option.ð ,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,Fantastic App and thank you for the videos but people in most countries peoole do not have the money or bandwidth to watch the videos on high quality.

Elsa,Education,It won't let me sign up/create a profile but it doesn't say why. All the error message says is An unexpected error occured. Please try again later...that tells me nothing. I have tried exiting and re-entering the app and re-entering my info but it still says the same thing.,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"Came back to Khan Academy after a few months and somewhere along the way an update (v6.10.0) rendered this app nonfunctional. Intermittently practice questions, quizzes and reviews will freeze when checking the answer. Exiting the quiz, program, or app and restarting does not solve the problem as you'll end up stuck at a blank screen upon returning to said question. Until they fix this issue, there's really reason to use this app.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,Please explain why you only get 1 chance at a question and if you fail you dont get a second or third chance.Its really stupid because some of the videos don't explain it enough and when you go do the quiz you fail the question once its done no more chances.Make it so we have at least 2 or 3 chances.Edit:I CANT GET ANYTHING RIGHT IT SAYS MAKE THE LOWEST TERM I DO AND IT SAYS WRONG AND PUTS SOME RANDOM MIDDLE TERM OR LARGE TERM NUMBER.SO CONFUSED????,Negative,BR

Elsa,Education,"Tried to do the first practice lesson,writing numbers in standard form, basic stuff. Got to question 2 of 7 and it will not allow me to to check my answer, I am literally stuck. I even tried using a hint, which counted against me, to see if it would let me check my answer then. Still nothing. Then I find out there is literally no one I can report this bug to so they can fix it and I can resume brushing up on my math. I'll just use youtube and online worksheets instead of wasting my time.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,"It's very buggy and everytime I want to play a video it theres a 6 second delay between me pressing start and the video actually starting. Plus, when there are consecutive videos I would like to watch they do not automatically go to the next video which is a nuisance since I dont want to scroll all the way to the next video.

Elsa,Education,"i downloaded this app based on a recommendation but as I'm screening it for my son I'm receiving task errors on everything. Hopefully this issue is resolved soon, this is pretty disappointing.",Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,It is the best app for study vut the biggest problem is that while taking unit test if one question gets wrong so the points will decrease in a great ammount and if there is one question wrong so there should be a resing option and after resinning we can do it again,Negative,BR
Elsa,Education,App worked wonderfully. Now the app struggles to load exercises and freezes upon completion of tests. Very unfortunate. Khan academy is a phenomenal resource.,Negative,BR

Elsa,Education,This is horrible they teach you one way they want you to do it but give a test. About a way they haven't explained in my my opinion you should teach the way every way it could be asked . This is why you really shouldn't do online learning.

Still no offline mode. Like why does a dictionary database even have to be that large in the first place, there should be a version without audio and unnecessary additions.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"I recommend not to download it, because there are other better dictionaries that give you more free features, like allowing you to hear pronunciation of the word you're looking for and its examples as well in the free version, and other free features too",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"Utterly disappointing tosh. Most searches end up with an advert that you can't get rid of, so you end up having to shut down the app and re-open it before starting again.

Oxford,Education,This app if full of ads you see ads every 5 seconds until you buy the premium version which costs a lot. Hated it dont waste time downloading it . Poor interface,Negative,VU

Oxford,Education,"Although the print version of this dictionary is quite good, the app is another story. Basically, the company is overly greedy. Not only is the app filled with intrusive advertising, the ads are created to be as annoying and obstructionist as possible to manipulate users into shelling out money for the paid version. I honestly would not mind paying for a quality dictionary app, but then they expect you to pay an additional $15 annually? It's exorbitant and outrageous. You certainly wouldn't have such an unreasonable stipulation for the print version of the dictionary!",Negative,VU

Oxford,Education,Waste of money. Contains annoying advertisements. Recent updates made it user hostile. Simple hoaxing to squeeze money. I am uninstalling it. I am writing this about paid version of the application.,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"Their most recent update made the free version unusable. You can only look up one word a day, unless you pay $10/year. They changed their set up so that they could make more money off of users, but hopefully they'll realize soon they're only lossing money this way and go back to ads. If that happens I'll come back and they'll make money off me again.

Several reviews show the same frustration, and the developers respond unapologetically that, yep, that's how it is, and that's how it's gonna stay.

Oxford,Education,"This app was my favourite dictionary app, but not now! The developers have screwed it up, by slowing it down so much, in the hope we will purchase the premium version?

Oxford,Education,"Uninstalled after recent update allowing only one lookup per day unless you pay for the premium version, at a ridiculous rate and requiring an annual subscription. Stupid business decision - before this change you at least got ad revenue from me. Now you don't get a penny. This app was great for our Scrabble games. Using another dictionary app now.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,You have to pay to access a lot of words. As a student without money to spend it's just better for me to use the completely free online version.,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,When I first tried this app I liked it so much that Within a day of downloading it I purchased the full version. I was able to use it completely explore the app and see the features of it with only the usual type of ads being displayed in the free version. MOBI has changed its policy to one free word per day it gives you no opportunity to really explore the app or see what it's like. To me this is predatory marketing and shows the attitude that the company has adopted No longer recommended,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,Totally Garbage & Waste of Time. Earlier it was working good. But after the recent update it is not working at all. it just reflect searching but result are shown. For Offline version it ask 159/- one time payment. When ONLINE version is not working then obviously OFFLINE will also not be working. I am UNINSTALLING it with a disappointed heart. If anyone know any good dictionary app please do reply to this comment.,Negative,VU

For two days now, I get the message, that I used my one free word/day, although I didn't use my one free word/day. The definition of worthless. I could get a free 3 day trial, but why should I do that for anything that sucks that bad? Seriously. Better $90/yr on the OED website, say I.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"I have already paid for the Premium version of the app, but with the latest update, there is a new Premium membership which totally superseded the previous payment that I did. Now I have to watch adds to use the features which I already had paid for. Edit: I know how to restore the license that I bought, is just that with this licensing service, every single day that I open my daily word, I receive a reminder to pay for the new premium service, more spam for the things that were already working fine. I bet you didn't took this use case in consideration during your tests.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"Glad I've got the printed version. Pay for the app if it gets rid of the ads. Screens are simply SO busy with ads I couldn't even see how to look up the words. It's a dictionary, some things should stay in print.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"I bought the premium version, yet it's off line mode could not work. Turned out its a known issue, if you browse on line or just in the reviews under this app, you will find the same complaint times and again. And every time their tech support would give you the same answer: it's not our problem it bcuz you use storage cleaner apps. Yet mine does'nt have one. If I were their coder of Mobi system I'd not be proud. Save your dollars for other apps.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"One free word a day is practically useless. Why even bother having a free version, if that is how limited it is. Just make it cost money in the first place so that people don't waste their time downloading it unless they want to pay for it. Also, that's what ads are for. Plenty of apps are free due to advertising...",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"Checked one word and upon the second the quota was up; the purchase of a premium version was being called for. Britain really has fallen from the old glory, even the promotion of English as a culture is too extravagant. Oxford Dictionary with such an old name can not afford to survive.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"This app is a nuisance unless you get the paid version. It interrupts you constantly, prompting to buy the paid version and you can't listen to the audio clip of word pronunciations with the free version. If you don't want to pay then there's no reason to use this instead of googling a word.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,Demanding the premium version subscription as soon as I installed the. App.,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,I purchased the pro version. But need to download offline content daily. Nearly 300mb daily download to use the app offline. Horrible. Never experienced such in other paid applications???????????? Already downloaded offline content 4 times. But daily I'm getting the info regarding fresh download,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"I do not recommend the app! That's completely ridiculous! You really give just one free definition per day? If you want everyone to go to premium, then update the app to a pre-paid version. I'll never install this app once again.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"Why is it necessary to access to Photos and gallery? And so many adds. Allow me to use the dictionary without providing access to the photos, i will be happy to update my rating to better one, and I'll be happy to use the compromised version, if any, in case i don't give photos access.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,DON'T BOTHER! You get a limited number of words per day - which is absolute trash. If you dont like that then you have to pay a monthly fee. At this point just buy a book version as it'll be cheaper in the long term. AWFUL APP,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,After paying for the full version last year it's now unavailable. The payment has been replaced with a subscription and it's wiped out my purchase. Horrible way to do business...,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"Horribly overpriced, even the free version! Have to watch a 20-30 second video for EACH word lookup. The paid version is $19.99 /year... expensive & you don't even own it, you just RENT it each year! I removed app after using it just 5 times!",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,Does not work in offline mode despite having paid version and downloaded offline content. Every time i try to switch to offline mode it asks to download files and even though files are downloaded next time again it will download files. Only works when connected to internet. Waste of money,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,Free version has so many full-screen ads that it's useless. Some of these are high-bandwidth video ads WITH SOUND. This is outrageous. Deleted.,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"Completely unusable. The ads are atrocious and make the user experience abhorrent. The free version is so bad, there is no way I would be willing to pay for the paid version to get rid of the ads.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,I uninstalled this app as it is useless without a subscription. The free version only gives access to one word a day. This should not be marketed as free at all. I'd be willing to pay a one-time fee but I cannot understand how the cost of subscription is justified.,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"Ads with sound? No thanks. Uninstalling. I understand that the free version relies on ads and I don't mind seeing them when they have text, pictures or videos. But sound is too intrusive.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,Waste of time! When you tap on the word you just looked up it doesn't let you see the definition unless you buy the premium version of the app. You literally can do nothing without purchasing the app. Isn't it beautiful?,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"Just installed this App, on entering first word itself, it is telling to go for PREMIUM option, so decided uninstal. My suggestion, why the App developer to put in free category instead better to put in paid version. Hope Android team will regulate such...",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"Waste app... Though I purchased premium version of this app, It shows regularly to download offline contents for offline use, I have downloaded it for more than 20 times , Still it shows notification to download offline contents after two three days use of offline dictionary.

Oxford,Education,I download the app and try to look up a word. I get hit with a pop up saying I've used up all my free word searches (this is the first time I've ever used this app) and that I need to purchase the premium version. Steer clear of this trash.,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,SO many common words NOT defined. A pathetic version of the of-so-reliable printed version. Free but not worth 1 cent! Also SO annoying that every time you open this app it asks for a FIVE (!) Star rating. What hubris!,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"Purchased premium and downloaded offline dictionary. But everytime i am reopening app, again i have to download offline dictionary again. Full bug with offline. Pls rethink before purchasing full version. Wastage of money for premium.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,Misleading. Hence pathetic. Once you try input with the mic the app prompts you to buy advanced version. It's not a big deal. 10 swiss francs per year. But the approach sucks. ððð,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"Intrusive ads and severe limitations for non-paying users, the paid version may be good but if you don't want to pay for the app, don't try it. Tip : Linguee dictionary",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"In order to get access to definition of one, I repeat ONE word you have to watch 30 seconds of an ad. Current state of free version is unusable.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,Not free as word limit per day. Now subscription based as company want to con people. I can buy an Oxford dictionary for Â£10 each year. This company want you to pay monthly instead of a one off fee for a version of the app. Why not release 2020 version then next year updated version 2022 and so on.,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,I paid through INR 79 to avail paid version but it was not accessible by me... please solve it...I raised a issue again i shared with my payment details with their support team but no solution taken by them but they denied.Ithink it is a fake to show premium content....very pathetic.I already given my bank statement for balance deduction with proof but they denied.Stop fooling people from other continent....,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"Hey atleast include any feature in offline or in unpaid form. Ads are there no problem, we adjust with that because of unpaid version but you have to give minimum options.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,I paid for this app and when tried to reinstall it on my tablet it would ask for annual subscription for premium version. No more payments!!!!!!!!! You won't se a dime from me anymore.,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"Even after downloading the offline database, after sometime I'm again asked to download the database again. Because of this I'm forced to use online mode even after paying for pro version.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,It doesn't work at all. Doesn't give the meaning even after 1 minutes of searching. I don't know what's the problem. Maybe only the paid version works properly,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"Very poor experience. Refuses to load simple definition queries passed via e readers, and trying any option like offline definitions just pushes for paid version. The opposite of useful or easy.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"The level of adverts in the free version makes it unusable, and it will be a cold day in hell when I spend Â£20 on a dictionary app.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,I purchased my premium version but couldnt download the databases.

Oxford,Education,"Yesterday, after updating to the latest, I tried to re-install an older version of the app via package manager (APK file) because I didn't like the latest one, but then I was unable to install/open any Oxford dictionaries/apps via APK files, and was able to install them via Google Play only. This is happening only with Oxford dictionaries/apps and not with any other apps. Why? Please fix this ASAP. It's very frustrating. Why am I unable to install Oxford dictionaries/apps via APK files anymore?",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,A dictionary app with a monthly subscription that does basically what any free search engine does? A free version where you have to watch an ad for one word meaning? Your ratings are going to go down so quickly!,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"Great for a day or two. Since paying for the full version I now have a widget that I can do nothing with. Sure, I get a notification for the word of the day but that's not much use if you can't search the dictionary. How do I get a refund?",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"'Free' version only works online and is jammed with ads. Considering number downloaded, price is far too high. Big disappointment.",Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,This app is paywalled. I'm sure the pay version is nice but this free version is not useful. Don't waste your time. Either buy the real app or look elsewhere.,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,Never seen a app like this before. Shows a add every time you search a word. Also the premium version is not upto the worth .,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,I downloaded the app. Searched for ONE word in it. And it told me I used up all my free words for that day and asked me to buy a full version. I didn't use any words yet... It lies to you that it's free. Edit. I did not click on anything before searching for the word that interested me.,Negative,VU
Oxford,Education,"Not worth the time. The app doesn't pronounce the words unless it is the paid version ... And in addition to that, it is flooded with unwanted ads.",Negative,VU

Dictionary ,Education,When I first tried this app I liked it so much that Within a day of downloading it I purchased the full version. I was able to use it completely explore the app and see the features of it with only the usual type of ads being displayed in the free version.

Now I have to watch adds to use the features which I already had paid for. Edit: I know how to restore the license that I bought, is just that with this licensing service, every single day that I open my daily word, I receive a reminder to pay for the new premium service, more spam for the things that were already working fine.

Dictionary ,Education,"I downloaded this app for it's word of the day feature, and it has been an utter disappointment in that regard.

The desktop version doesn't have these hearts, so I am able to learn from my mistakes and at my own pace. The desktop version works in a mobile browser. This app hinders learning. Go to the website.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Using to learn French for 543 days now, paid nearly $90 just to never see ads(for one year), and not have hearts. Which, if you're trying to use this without paying that good luck. Honestly it's sad, the stuff they've been adding recently is just not good at all. I couldn't care about a ""mistakes tab"" or having to sit through 3 second clips after the end of a lesson. I'm just trying to get in, learn and get out. The only good update was when they added darkmode, no settings to turn off trash.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"I would've given 5 stars until now, but the recent updates suck. I hate the new ""heart"" mechanic, especially considering that the new content has buggy questions without correct answers.

Overall the app is still good, but the updates should probably be more polished before release.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,I do not recommend this for people wanting to learn a new language. Not only do you have to get every single word right (which is impossible with some words) but it's also boring.

They tried making it more fun but all it is is absolutely infuriating.,Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Used to be a great app, and I was happy to tolerate the repeated advertising. The updates since Easter now limit free learning to five errors per session with enforced breaks of hours unless you subscribe. The entire process to this point was based on putting in the time and completing lessons. Now they end half way through if you make too many errors and no further access without paying.

duolingo,Education,I used to love this app and use it daily. There was a new update I assume that made it unusable on my phone. I cannot swap between languages nor can I tap on any lesson.

duolingo,Education,"This app used to be great, now you have lives and when you're out you need to refill or wait. Sometimes it takes 2 lives for a mistake. Than you have an add that says that they are trying to make the learning free and fun but with every update they are trying to make users pay for the premium version by putting limits on how much you can play. This leads this app to be barely playable and impossible to enjoy. Lastly, in Greek course they messed up the lessons so all of the progress made is gone",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,The app was working well until a recent update and now I am not able to select lessons from the menu. Having managed to get up to a streak of around 235 days it's slightly disappointing that this won't be preserved and that I can't access lessons daily as I used to.

duolingo,Education,"Duolingo was wonderful, but after the last update it is horrible. They changed the font to a much smaller san serif which makes it quite difficult for me to see.

I'm not sure, but I will probably delete Duolingo and try Babble.",Negative,VU

duolingo,Education,Used to be a brilliant app. The hearts system is terrible and means you can't finish the harder lessons without paying for it. Big mistake that will result in many lost users if not corrected. Update: I was hoping to get used to the hearts system but it just punishes you for making mistakes. I learn by making mistakes over and over. This system means I have to wait a day to practice the new content again or change focus onto other content to regain hearts.,Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Just restarted using this app, loved it before and had contemplated paying for the ""pro"" subscription. But with the update, they give you a limited number of ""wrong answers."" If you deplete this limit and don't purchase more, the lesson automatically terminates making you start over. This is a user pain point.

After losing a ton of progress with a major update, distracting little characters were added with speech bubbles that don't match the narrator, as if this is catered to 5 year olds. Now the app will give you a chance to 'double' your XP on an exercise by taking a more difficult lesson. What it failed to say was there is no streak bonus, so if you do well, it actually does not double the XP.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,makes learning impossible. everything has been updated to make it completely unusable to learn unless you have duolinguo plus. every simple mistake is penalized. it prides itself on being a replacement for school classes but I don't ever remember a school lesson kicking me out for missing too many answers to tell me I need to pay money to get the premium experience. I used to love this app and it made me excited to study Spanish. now I dread it in case I miss too many questions. this app sucks.,Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"I used to love this app but the new blue gems and the heart system are horrible. The gems used to mean something but now the amount you earn is disproportionate to the amount you have to spend so they are worthless. And the hearts mean you are getting penalized instead of learning from mistakes. It's just not fun or useful anymore. Update: No change, the system just feels like a Money-grab now. I actually actively recommend people not to get it, you will not learn unless you pay. Don't bother.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,The updated version stinks! It was a good app before that. Now it constantly glitches and freezes on every other phrase on all the devices I've tried learning on. It also keeps kicking me out of lessons making it impossible for keeping my score up. As something I use to look forward to use on the daily I'm deeply upset that this update is prohibiting me from learning.,Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Been using this app for a year now learning Russian. I love the course. I have my issues with the way duolingo teaches, but if you make an effort is an amazing tool. All that said, the new hearts system they have introduced is a real kick in the balls. It's absolutely terrible and makes the app basically useless unless you pay. If you haven't yet chosen a language app, PICK ANOTHER. Unless they get rid of the hearts system DO NOT USE THIS APP. Update: they still haven't fixed it. Unusable.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"I use to love this app so much, could spend all day learning languages. Now with the new heart system I am punished for getting incorrect answers.

duolingo,Education,"With all due respect, could you fix your damn servers already? Connection issues appear on a daily basis. Every other app on my phone works fine. Problems happen only in Duolingo. Update: it's been almost a week and the problem is still there. Judging by other reviews, thousands of other people experience the same problem. You've built a company that's worth billions but still can't solve basic issues. Right. You're probably just too busy pushing people to buy premium accounts. Great work.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"I used to love this app but the latest update has made it almost impossible to use without paying. Yes, I agree that software developers need to be paid for their work, but with the amount of advertising we're bombarded with between lessons and 100M+ installs I don't believe any payment is warranted. I use the app to study 11 languages, ranging in level from absolute beginner to almost expert, but my frustration since the last update has me on the verge of uninstalling it. Please remove the idiotic ""innovation"" of only allowing 5 mistakes per day (for someone who only has time to use the app in the evening the fact that the hearts slowly build up again over a period of hours is useless) and give your enormous user base reason to continue using this app Update April 2021: Not only do they continue to use the stupid points system, but the software is now full of bugs. I got a perfect score on the final checkpoint for the French course, only to see the points I gained disappear, even though the system says I finished the checkpoint. Most days I have to cut my studying short because I run out hearts - it's no use trying to push myself, as the extra effort is penalised instead of rewarded.

I guess some concepts are too hard for you to grasp...",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Duolingo used to be my go to for learning a language but the new update is terrible. The lives take away the purpose of self paced learning, the stories are a good addition, but the content in the lessons is terrible. It is very repetitive of useless phrases. There is not enough focus on grammar or spelling and many of the questions are multiple choice meaning you don't actually learn anything. The voices are computer generated and it doesn't pick up on pronunciation. Btw I am learning french.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Duolingo used to be my go to free way of learning, however since re-downloading and losing hearts thereby losing progress for making mistakes, I've been completely thrown off and am gonna find an alternative.

duolingo,Education,"Decent app, have used it for years.

duolingo,Education,All updates have been garbage. The Japanese update was more hiragana & katakana. Seriously?! After all that hype about revamping it??

duolingo,Education,"I already gave the app 2 stars in my last review and it just gets worse. There is too much latency since the last update; some of the selections don't work and I get incorrect answers.

I'll just stick with lingodeer.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Upd: The app keeps switching to offline even though there are no connection issues. The update didn't help. _ Hey Duo, here's the thing. As much as I enjoy your lessons, the loud and obnoxious ads is the one and only reason why I'll never pay for Plus. I'm not supporting your devs who don't mind blasting full-volume ads at the unsuspecting non-paying users who just finished a lesson with listening exercises. It'd be great if you could drop them a hint that perhaps it's not such a good idea.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"I'm sad that it was updated so that now you can only mess up five times before having to spend your lingots on more hearts to continue to learn that language. Or you have to pay for the full app to have unlimited hearts. This was the one cool language app and everyone knew that, but they ruined that and I'm so disappointed.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"This app was ok before, but never updated in a meaningful way. Then they tried to ""gamify"" it too much and now it's just garbage. My favorite part is how you can now pay 200 gems to try to skip a level, but are only awarded 6 gems if you pass (/s). I already feel bad enough competing with people who have more time and knock me down every week. On top of this the thirsty ads and incessant popups for Duo+ are gross. One star though for improving Japanese with the new Hiragana/Katakana tab tho.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"This app is indeed a useful one. However, a matter of regret that the app didn't include all spoken language in the world. Like, I am a Bengali speaker. 'What language do you speak ' didn't mention about Bengali language. Being a Bengali speaker, I couldn't use the app properly. So it would be better if the app is updated. Waiting for the response. Thank you",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"One star specifically because of the idiotic heart system. It actively inhibits learning by punishing mistakes, and is a obvious attempt to push people towards the paid app. Until the latest update, I was on the version of the app without hearts, and had been using it for years. Now, I am leaning towards uninstalling and finding another way to learn languages. Update: the number and irritating nature of ads has also increased.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"I know that language is a difficult thing for a computer but this app rejects plenty of valid answers. It also fails to specify things like singular or plural in areas where it isn't clear in English (eg ""you""). This makes it confusing for knowing the correct translation. This is a pretty irritating app. Apart from the annoying interface, things like updates take ages. I have a good Internet connection (via wifi) and the current update has been running for 3 hours now and is up to 32%.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"I'm rating a 1 based on the newest update for the free version. The heart system is terrible. I do my daily lessons with my son, who is more likely to make a mistake for us due to accidently pressing an incorrect button. Being kicked out of a lesson and losing progress is so much more frustrating and does not motivate me to keep going. Challenging a difficult lesson will no longer be enjoyable. Update: it also no longer holds progress if you switch between apps. All lesson progress lost. Awful",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"They have totally destroyed the experience in this app. As a teacher myself and having used this app for more than a year, the latest updates deter from the fun learning experience offered before. Now you run out of hearts which makes it a harrowing experience and one that is time consuming and demotivating. You can practice to gain hearts but not the skill you keep failing on. Great if you are just getting started but prepare to have your progress staggered and delayed.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"This app was supposed to be about free education, but it became corrupted with a recent update. Now the app punishes you for your mistakes and makes it more difficult to keep a streak and keep practicing daily. Buying premium supposedly helps you support free education, but at that point its not free anymore. This was supposed to be and app for education, not a game. People learn by making mistakes, I just hope duolingo learns from theirs.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Before duolingo was updated, there was no hearts. It was more free. I make a mistake and learn. When they added hearts, I would fail most of my lessons and won't have enough money to buy new hearts. Its better to learn duolingo online where there is not hearts and you won't fear making a mistake in a lesson and you can finish a lot more lessons. My dad finishes 25 lessons a day when he does it online. I finish around 10. When I do it on the app, my father does like 5 lesson, and I would do 2.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Going from the best to possiblity worst language learning app with just one update. Not only there is more advertisment than the content, but there is this horrible ""hearts"" system. You have 5 hearts, and a mistake costs you a heart. Mistakes tolerance has gone down from previous version. And on top of that the hint gives you the WRONG answer. Solution? Buy premium. Blatant cashgrab. Duolingo was never good enough to learn a language, but was at least a good addition. Now it's just horrible.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Learning French. Recently (end Feb 2021 after update) I ran in to problems with a lot of audio examples being quiet. It happens when playing an audio sample and having four ""spelling examples"" to choose from, also one or more of the four possible answers are silent.

duolingo,Education,"New update cant do the speaking excersise any more. Always struck a little and then ""that doesnt sound right"" ðð",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"It REALLY REALLY upsets me that if the exercises in a course are updated you lose all of your crowns and progress for those! I've been exercising 200+ days on German and I have to redo the basics to get to levels 1, 2, 3... again and again... The update warning does not tell you about this really big issue! UPDATE: Recently introduced ""in app"" notifications about the achievements of people I follow. They are annoying and there is no way to disable them. The only option is to unfollow people.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Needs work, audio all over the place, unintelligible at times. Too many americanisms, cookies? candies? No. Biscuits and sweets/sweeties!! Update, notification settings need improvement. Update, audio still as variable, still plagued by americanisms - unable to realise the world learns English as a universal language.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Since their recent update I find myself hating Duolingo! You're not able to make mistakes, you lose ""hearts"" and are bullied into purchasing more before you can continue your lessons. After not doing any lessons you have to start over in the file! The speaking lessons are hard to hear, I feel they do this on purpose so you'll mess up, then comes their instrusive ""premium"" ads; one actually interupted my lesson! Who are you guys trying to impress? App is junk, and not even worth it; uninstal!",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Loved this app at first. Was fun to learn and seemed to be working. Then in the last update it switched from failing an entire lesson lost a life, to each mistake does. When learning a new skill lesson locks you out for several hours if you miss 5 in 25. So 80% is failure lockout. Just a way to try to annoy users unto paying for premium. The last update also caused the keyboard to block what you are typing so you cannot proof read your answers. It also is 450 to refil mid lesson vs 350 in store.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,I really like the app. I really do. But I HATE how my friend on IOS has SO MANY more functions on her app then me!! We're learning together and it sucks that she gets extra experience from leaderboard boosts and has legendary levels when I don't even have the listening tab!! I understand trialing new features but this is too much of a difference. Please update android to match the IOS app. This is just too much.,Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,I am really confused. I searched up what the words are called in Spanish and English but I did not get the right one. When I searched it up (for example the word name) I got nombre but in Duolingo nombre was not an option. Can someone fix it or is Duolingo just teaching us nonsence.( Now after a few months after I wrote all that) I have updated Duolingo and I saw that the checkpoints were becoming SHORTER and the stories too. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS I LOVED TO LEARN,Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Rating was 5 stars until I updated. The heart system completely ruins the learning experience. You cannot learn efficiently while only being able to make 5 mistakes a day. Duolingo has completely undermined the function of its app, entirely in the name of greed. The ad supported version allowed Duolingo to become a hundred million dollar company, they don't need to punish language learners like this to keep growing.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Used virtually every day for a year and a half. Has had issues with male voice and occasional errors but solid. And was a useful tool to learn. 1 star Because, the update with the heart system is just pathetic. Comes off as a shameless cash grab on par with candy crush. Totally disgusting. Its now basically impossible to learn from mistakes. And beyond that, really cant stand the new element of terrible characters showing up mid lesson, obnoxious and just ugly. Really lowers the quality.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"An update deleted all of my progress after a 150 day streak, and I even paid for a yearly premium subscription! Do NOT download this app, there are better language learning apps that actually explain grammar or conjugation and won't make you figure out the rules of the language by yourself. I was halfway done with the Greek course and an update deleted 2/3 of my progress, and there's no customer support to call, email, or talk to! The email I sent was met with ""don't expect a personal reply""...",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"I used this app for a bit trying to learn German and fot busy and wasn't able to continue until recently I went to pick it back up again and the new updates that added hearts make it impossible to get back in to it, the whole appeal of the app from lessons that were paid for by adds in between and constant practice but the three hours to restore one heart just makes me not even consider paying for your scheme of a subscription",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,Just got the update for this app and you for some reason have gone back to this weird energy bar where you make mistakes you cannot progress. What you had before worked so why change it? I gave you 5 stars originally so now I am considering uninstalling it. My kids used it to learn Dutch and Spanish,Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Duolingo used to be amazing, but it has gotten worse every update. Now the constant bombardment of ads and new heart system make it basically unusable. They've strayed from their mission of making language learning easy and it's a shame.",Negative,VU

duolingo,Education,"I used to love this app until the last update introduced the heart system where you can only make one mistake every 4 hours, making mistakes is part of the learning process and if the app throw me out everytime I am out of hearts and I make a mistake then it's useless.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"After using the app everyday for almost a year, I opened it to find all my past completed lessons gone! Updates clear all your user and learning history. The moderators are rude and unhelpful. If the language you want to learn is available on another platform, use it over duolingo.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,The only app Ive ever used where the updates and changes are flawless and fun. Extremely well made.*update* and then they changed it to where you can't even do two lessons in a row and hearts take forever to regenerate so now I don't use it at all cause it's useless. UGH! Seriously you lost a fan Duo!,Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"My favorite part of duolingo was doing the stories. As a result, I made it really far into all of the Spanish stories. After a recent update, now, I can't do anymore stories until I obtain 400 crowns in the lesson section! Very disappointed",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Pedantic to the point of supidity, especially when incorrect translations are used for the answers...often stupid Americanisms. Used to be good and well done regularly updated.

duolingo,Education,"edit: new update is riddled with bugs. Such as, though I complete my daily goal, I lose my streak freeze. Frustrating when I have to spend gems every time Duo decides that I didn't log in and complete my dailies. Lost a 173 day steak this way... Done.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,I love this app because it helps you to learn but after the update with earning hearts and waiting 4 hours not a good strategy to PUSH people to buy premium. Mistakea are one way to learn but waiting will kill the enthusiasm to learn. So disappointed.,Negative,VU

duolingo,Education,NOBODY LIKES THE NEW UPDATE Removed the random test button which added variety rather than focusing only on one topic. The heart system is the worst idea ever! Who came up with this idea needs to be fired! Mistakes are common due to autocorrect and typos but now you get punished for this! Before you could learn all day without restriction now you have to pay if you lose your hearts. Disgusting and greedy pay to win mechanics do not belong on a learning app!

duolingo,Education,"Latest updates erased all my course progress. Reported the problem, haven't heard anything back. Really disappointed because this used to be a decent app. EDIT: Still never heard back from my email inquiry. FAQs now say this is because of them trying to match up with language learning standards, but there's no option to test out to get progress back. They need to balance new levels with not making their users feel like all the time they put into the app was wasted. Really bad UX experience.",Negative,VU

duolingo,Education,I truly hate the hearts system how is anyone able to learn if the mistakes they make count against them and they have to wait a day to be able to try again or pay 7 bucks a month. If this isn't fixed with the next update I'm uninstalling because this is ridiculous.,Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Before the hearts update, when I was struggling with a new topic I could practice until I understood it.

Also keep getting talking exercises when I have them turned off.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"This app used to be great, now you have lives and when you're out you need to refill or wait. Sometimes it takes 2 lives for a mistake. Than you have an add that says that they are trying to make the learning free and fun but with every update they are trying to make users pay for the premium version by putting limits on how much you can play.

duolingo,Education,"New updates make this app a lot more annoying. The clear attempts at the typical strategies of annoying the user into spending money immediately make me want to uninstall.

duolingo,Education,It was a very good app until the newest update came. U cant move onto the next lesson without hearts and if you make mistakes the hearts decrease. If u want more hearts u gotta pay money....I thought this was a FREE learning app..... Please remove these updates and bring back the original version. So disappointing â_____â,Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,Was great but is going downhill. The heart system is a great way to screw poor people out of an education and the recent update has a lot of malfunctions including not being able to open and start lessons or switch languages,Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,I used to love this app and use it daily. There was a new update I assume that made it unusable on my phone. I cannot swap between languages nor can I tap on any lesson. I am just there staring at the main screen and can only go look at the store/leaderboard. The UX copy for the streak freeze description is also very poor work. I have no clue what 1/2 equipped does versus 2/2. Please test your new features before releasing.,Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Since last update, can't access lessons unless I have purchased a streak freeze. This bug is most likely due to the pop up asking if I want to purchase one. Makes the main portion of the app literally unusable.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,"Using to learn French for 543 days now, paid nearly $90 just to never see ads(for one year), and not have hearts. Which, if you're trying to use this without paying that good luck. Honestly it's sad, the stuff they've been adding recently is just not good at all. I couldn't care about a ""mistakes tab"" or having to sit through 3 second clips after the end of a lesson. I'm just trying to get in, learn and get out. The only good update was when they added darkmode, no settings to turn off trash.",Negative,VU
duolingo,Education,Not liking the new update there really pushing you to pay for pluse. Also they need to have there speaker speak clearly I don't know how many times I hear them say una and estas and it turns out to be un and este it like they want you to run out of turns and buy pluse.

It helped me with numerous math hw, and it also explains how to solve it. After the update however, the camera on Photomath wont focus on the part Im scanning. I scan it directly on what I want to be solved, and the part it scans ends up tilted for some reason. So now its basically unusable. I hope it gets fixed soon.",Negative,VU

photomath,Education,"The update messed up everything. I've been using photo math for years now. Not only did I use it for getting homework answers to my assignments, but also it's useful in teaching me the procedure for doing a math problem. It was today when I tapped the ""explain"" button and the whole new ""Photomath Plus"" offer showed up. At first thought this was an app project to help students, not do business with them. But now that's changed. Uninstalling since it no longer serves my needs to explain problems.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"This app was amazing until the new updates require you pay to see the detailed steps. As a college student, this was a great resource for helping with my math homework when I didn't have access to a tutor.

I cannot afford to pay for the ""new"" features as I already have student loans to pay for. :(",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,It was perfect until the latest update. Why did you have to destroy it? The Android version was beyond better than the iOS but for an unknown reason you though that redesigning it would be better.

photomath,Education,"For me, the new update just ruined everything. The last version was better in a way that I can freely slide from camer to calculator to history and such but now I need to press it to change it.

photomath,Education,"The app used to be good until the updated, removing the ""show options"" feature that you have to pay for.

photomath,Education,"Oh my god!!!! They have made it so bad!!!! It is worse than ever................these new updates are killing me.They are so bad..................It was very very very helpful earlier but now it is GARBAGE. The automatic question recognition was something ultimate but now when the shutter has came its just like other apps. The step by step explaination is also now gone. Please remove this new update. And a word of advice for the creators ""Your bussiness will go down""",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"This app used to be great, but it just auto updated and basically took away the only useful feature I needed. In the problem solving steps, instead of offering to show the steps, there's now a button that says ""explain how"". Clicking on it I just get a prompt saying I need to upgrade to unlock that feature. I was under the impression that core features were supposed to be free. Guess not anymore. Uninstalling; I could just bug my professor for the money I already pay.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"Used to love this app until the new update. Now it basically only shows the answers, which is useless as the best feature was that it showed step by step how to solve the problem, it is now very frustrating as parts of the solution remain unexplained. If only a one off payment was required I would definitely consider paying, but as a broke student a monthly fee is just not realistic :( very disappointing. For Â£9 a month I'll pay for Netflix and watch that instead of doing the homework.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"I love this before because it is very helpful, but when they updated it to have PhotoMath Plus, this give us hard time",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"Literally no one here has $10 lying around for PhotomathPlus. All the responses from the team talk about how it's needed for fees for AI tutorials, etc. However, Im assuming that what we need the most (answers/COMPLETE steps) would still be free to run right? That was how it was done before the update. Could there be a setting option to just turn off all the fancy stuff and go back to no ads/complete steps w/o using money? Or just create another app (that costs $ to download) w/ the new things.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"I would say the recent update ruined this app. It feels less refined and the new styling is just not my thing. In the old version you're able to insert two functions and a graph will show you where it intersects, but now the graph will simply not show. Also, i like it when i used to be able to simply slide to move from camera and calculator. Overall, the old version seems way better than this version.",Negative,VU

For others looking to bypass the paywall: Goto apkmirror and download version 6.0.1 (The version right before the crappy update) >>Android Only<< >>Don't forget to turn off auto update.<< Developers clearly don't know their consumer base.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"Before the new update, it was the best app for this purpose but now after the update, I think that it's the worst app because I was using it to solve problems and to remember how it was solved. After all, the main problem is, its premium version which unables us to see how the question is solved. So it is humble request to solve this issue because all the stundents can't pay the cost for premium one.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,editing my 5 star review (which I posted a year ago) because the new update made the app horrible. Photomath was one of the best app for learning math and making it easy; but now? Too many adds have completely spoiled the experience and what used to be free is now paid? Horrible experience. The old photomath was the best. Dev team please do something about this.,Negative,VU
photomath,Education,This app used to be the best thing in explaining steps in problems that my online class couldn't even explain well. The function that explains the reasoning of problems was free until the recent update which now has a pay wall behind it. You might as well get a real tutor instead. The app now has ads that slow you down. This clearly is a money grab now. The devs lack the care of the students now based on the unhelpful copy and paste responses to these reviews.,Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"This new update is actually horrible. I hate how the default page is now the camera, because half the time I don't use the camera since it can be unreliable. Not to mention it keeps turning on my camera which is annoying. And that's not even all. This app used to be great at calculating, now all if I put (1-x-6x^2)^5, all it does is reorder the terms, it doesn't expand at all. If I enter it the ordered way, it shows a uselesa graph. Please Photomath, go back to being a great app.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,This app used to be great but after an update it became plauged with constant advertising everytime you take a snap of a problem an ad pops out also for most solution to view the steps it asks for their premium membership something that was free before... and a core concept of the whole app since in most cases the process is what you are looking for.,Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"I hate the new update!!!! Can you guys please change it back to how it was. Because in the new one you can even choose which method you can use to solve a quadratic equation, in the old one you could choose. Most of the equations i scan show me that they can't solve the problem,even easy ones...this was hardly the case before but,now it's very often that i get that message. PLEASE,CAN IT BE BACK TO HOW IT WAS!!!!!",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"Before the update, they used to explain how to solve equations. I can't understand the ideas of solving just because of the *photomath plus* that is a paid subscription for explanations. They used to explain for free, and now they're telling us to pay! I'd rate this a half-star since they deserved it. I'm not even 18 to have myself a credit card. Greedy idiots. Edit: I just realized that Photomath devs are copying responses to who's disliking the subscription idea. No direct communication I see.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"I'm in Algebra 2 and struggle a bit with math, and this app helps me a lot in regards to understanding the problems I'm trying to work on and understanding the concepts we're trying to learn. That said, the recent update has put a paywall behind solving different math problems called ""Photomath Plus"". It no longer gives the steps to solving certain equations and only shows the answer, which is useless to me. The paywall too is ludicrous, considering most who use this app are students.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"What happened to the old layout and design of the app??? To be honest I've been very disappointed with the new updates, which seemingly degrades the quality of the app, which I am sorry to say.

Kindly fix these problems to let me to give you 5 star rating because we all know that it is the best app to solve mathematical problems Thanking you, Yours faithfully, Your app user.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,DISABLE CAMERA AUTO FOCUS. The update that added auto focus to the camera ruined the app. The camera will almost never focus probably. This makes it impossible to solve problems from a photo. That was the one feature that made this app better than its competitors and now it's gone. I loved this app before that update and everything else is great. Please add a way to disable the auto focus.,Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"I got this a few years ago for the beginning of high school and it was so amazing! It walked you through all the steps and evrything.

photomath,Education,"the new camera update is awful, it takes ages for it to take a focused picture. It was so much better when the lense scanned the math problem directly than this new update where you need to take the picture for the app to scan the math problem.

photomath,Education,"PHOTOMATH IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE!!! I've been using Photomath since before, it has helped me in a lot of assignments.

THE PREVIOUS VERSION WAS BETTER CAUSE MOST OF US USERS CAN AFFORD THINGS",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,In the beginning it was good but with the recent update which adds in the pay to use well solution I find this unsatisfying... As a student myself I agree that it's useful but the fee for the important extra info was and still is a bad idea. Hope you change back to normal Until then I'll keep it a 1 star rating.... And the response is as usual... Blatantly copied and then pasted... Disappointed,Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"The recent updates ruined the app. It takes longer to open, it's harder to type in the equations. I get that the whole point is to take a pic and get the app to solve it automatically, but the majority of the time I just want to write my equation and play with it, and Photomath is still the best for this. It would be best if it was faster to open and easier to type in equations.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"App was amazing until interface update. And now what do we have? Developer wrote in his blog that it's supposed to be free. Annoying ads, premium functions, laggy interface, camera detect is disgusting, dont even work properly. App was so well but now it ruined with help of your greed and bad updates.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,Photomath is a good app before but now photomath bought a new update with photomath plus whis is not good because people cannot afford such a high price like 840 rupees for 1 month. Without this photmath was the best app. Because of this new photomath plus we are not properly expkained any sum . Also the free trial for 7 days is fake,Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"dont like the new update were u manually take a picture of your problem, it just makes everthing slower, opposed to when you just had to scan the problem and the answer would just appear at the bottom. i wish i could just revert it back. that scan feature was the thing that really made this app stand out from the rest, now its just like the others horrible",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"Photomath turned into dogsh*t after the lastest updates. They are now charging money for step explanations, something majority of the user uses the app for. The developers of the application say that they keep the core of the app free. WELL PHOTOMATH DEVELOPERS, WE USE THE DAMN EXPLANATIONS THAT U ONCE HAD FOR FREE. THE EXPLANATION IS THE CORE OF THE APP. No one, not a single soul wants ur damn AI stuff.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,I love this app!!. The best!! UNTIL THE NEW UPDATE :( please remove the subscription or make the subscription keeping in mind students. $1-2 dollar a month is adequate. Thinking about catering to the masses and not the rich braty spoilt kids who dont study but have money to pay for this app. Last min studying . think about those who are in serious need.

photomath,Education,"Updates are supposed to improve user experience, I was using photomath a lot before update, and it helped me not only by solving problems, but mostly it showed me how to solve them, and since new update everything is hidden behind paywall. I guess it's time to find another app.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"I love this app or at least I use to. Since the recent update, it has destroyed what made it a good application. I know you're trying to get money, but you ruined this app for me with the update. The free version shouldn't take away the one things that has helped it's users just because it wants money. And honestly 10$? Jesus Christ, that's ridiculous.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,The new update is wores it's only can scan one,Negative,VU
photomath,Education,It was perfectly fine before the update. Now you can't even get how the problem was solved without paying for it. I got this app to help me with math because it was free and helpful and now all it does is solve it for me instead of helping me understand how figure it out. Don't get it if you want actual help with math.,Negative,VU
photomath,Education,It was all good but after the latest update i started to experience complications. I can't scan equation because the camera is upside down even though my phone and the equations are in a straight position. I have to manually write the equations and it's taking my time. pls fix this thanks.,Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"Ruined the app after the update, it used to help a lot, where I couldnt understand some problems through other apps or sites, photomath was my go to app and I spoke highly of it to anyone I knew that struggled with math, now I'm uninstalling the useless app since it dkesnt explain what I need unless I pay for it.

Thank you for the wonderful experience in the past and great disappointment in the present.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,What the hell. Whatever I experienced was worst. After the update it become the worstestest. I am not behind insulting you but it continuously repeats the same answer even when their is no kind of relationship in the question and the answer. I hope you will fix it or some more will have the most critical review ever .,Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"I always get disturbed by the feature that has been updated. I hate the 'turning on' of camera at the beginning. It wastes most of my time doing nothing and waiting for the system to correspond. You should add a setting in app that the turning on of camera would be controlled. If one wants, they should turn off the feature according to their own will. Thankyou",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"Used to be a great app, when the system use only scanning math problems, which is faster than the latest update. Taking picture of the math problem and waiting for how long is frustrating... And the answer didn't even appeared.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,This update is very bad. I will never use camera. Because not correctly seeing the things. I didnt have much time to wait open the app. I should have 100 in math subject. Some parts arent available ex . First derivative test. And second derivative test. Rates of change. And optimization .,Negative,VU
photomath,Education,Its a great app but the recent update has ruined the camera. Before it would give a guess when the camera was hovered over a question and the camera would focus nicely but the recent update has removed the preview function and ruined the camera as it will unfocus when i take a pic but refocus when i m not which is extremely annoying. Update: they ve made it worse somehow. The styling is their attempts to be more like social media but photomaths purpose is a calulator not where i go post selfies,Negative,VU
photomath,Education,Almost all the problems I'm trying to get help on need to be payed so I can see the steps. Why would I pay so much when i can just install an alternative. I really wonder how many actually subscriptions this app has made since the really money grabbing update. The only reason I even used this app was for the explanation otherwise just getting the answer does not help anyone learn which was the purpose of this app right? What happened to free education for all?,Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"I've had this app for about a year and I've never been more disappointed than I had been with the most recent update. To my knowledge the purpose of this app is supposed to help people solve a math problem.

I used to love this app, if something isn't broken don't fix it, so why did you fix it?",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"Well, I really liked this app at the beginning. It helped me in my exams, in fact it was like my mathematics teacher but after the update it has become useless without money.... Sorry, but it's no helping now.",Negative,VU
photomath,Education,This app used to be very helpful before the new update it helped me many times but after the update it started demanding for subscription i.e to pay money for the features which were previously available but now it demands money for explaining the steps too.,Negative,VU
photomath,Education,Latest update destroyed the app. I used to be able to find the simplified and exact forms of an answer on the same page but now it doesn't even do that. Would rather stick the the older version that was MUCH easier to use and find what I'm looking for.,Negative,VU
photomath,Education,"This was a great app. But the latest update just made everything too complicated, and It also doesn't show you the graph anymore. I love the developers and hope they restore the previous version.",Negative,VU

photomath,Education,"You guys made a photomath plus, which I don't like because when i do a mult digit decimal multiplication, it won't let me cause of the plus.

photomath,Education,"This used to be the best. Now that they changed how it scans the problem it is completely worthless!! Wont focus no matter what. Too bad they ruined a good thing.

photomath,Education,I hate ur new camera pic update!!!! I want the old search up answer feature that u had when u put it to where the equation was and it would instantly answer it with ez asap but now I think u should delete that snap shot feature where the camera starts to blur when u take the photo. it's just terrible.

And today, I was charged for the monthly fee because I was unable to cancel the trail. As a long time user and advocate of Duolingo (over 5 years) I am extremely disappointed and will not recommend this service to anyone at all anymore because of this fraudulent behavior the company has engaged in. A freemium application that encourages users to try out the Duolingo Plus and placing obstacles preventing users from canceling the subscription.
